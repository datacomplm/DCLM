Each spring sees another class sent forth with a liberal arts education to be of service in the field to which they are best suited. But a liberal arts education is not all work. McKendree also teaches brotherhood \u2014 not in classes, but through living together like brothers, all working together for the same cause, and each gener- ously sharing his personality with others about him. The leadership and participation in extra-curricular activities enables all young men and women to be of most service to their community, and the \"fam- ily\" atmosphere on the campus inspires them to live peacefully and happily with their families and friends as they go through life in true McKendree fashion.

They are always on hand when something needs to be done, and are always deeply interested in cooperating with the students in anything they undertake. It has been their constant supervision and cooperation that has made possible the sending of Reviews to all McKendree servicemen, both at home and abroad.

Inasmuch as the membership is quite low, a greater number in the near future is expected. Although the \"M\" Club has not been too active during the past year, it sponsored, quite proudly, the election of the Home-coming Queen.

Who's Who Among Students in American Universities and Colleges is a publica- tion of a standard directory and index of information sponsored by six hundred colleges and universities. Its purpose is to give national recognition to students of unusual abilities. Below are listed six McKendree seniors who will appear in the 1944-45 edition. EDNA KAMPMEYER Edna possesses a rare sense of responsibility and she has made a good scholastic record at McKendree. Her cooperative and friendly spirit will be greatly missed on the \"Old Hill.\" FRANK SNYDER We admire Frank, one of our older students, for re- turning to school to graduate while holding a full-time position His ability in chemistry and mathematics i? outstanding RUTH KOERBER The quick wit and cheerful disposition of our Mc- Kendrean editor combine to make her a capable leader. She has proved herself to be a good student and depend- able office assistant. WILLIAM STALLINGS The high scholastic record and fine leadership shown by Bill during his years on the \"Old Hill\" make the rest of us proud to call him a McKendrean SHIRLEY BERGMAN Shirley's quick smile and pleasing personality have won many friends for her at McKendree She has been an ex- cellent student and an outstanding leader during her three years on the campus NORMAN BAKER Norman's cheerful smile and keen sense of humor make him a welcome addition to the McKendree family McKENDREAN-REVIEW STAFF BOTTOM ROW (left to right): W.

Not only did this staff publish the bi-weekly paper and this annual, but it spon- sored a fall leaf-raking and the high school day in the spring. Just as other groups, the staff operated under war-time difficulties. Much \"midnight oil\" was burned to complete copy for deadlines Many afternoons were used for trips to St. Louis to arrange for printing and engraving After a year of presenting the current happenings on our campus, we offer this book as the culmination of our activities. The memories embodied in these pages will long serve to remind us of the \"Old Hill\" and those with whom we worked and played in '44-'45.

BASKETBALL LETTERM EN Laurel Berger I Forward I \u2014 Berger had the best free throw average on the team Laurie was fastest on the first five, and perhaps the best \"all around\" player. He certainly snagged more than one rebound. Berger will be here next year to add his much- needed strength to the team Ira Thetford Captain (Guard) \u2014 \"Tiny,\" a two-year letterman, could always be depended up- on to handle the ball well. He was calm and cool-headed on the floor, and was always under the basket for rebounds. Gleason Lagow (Forward) \u2014 Joe, small, but mighty, proved to be one of the Bearcats' best subs He is one of the cleverest ball handlers on the team Joe will be here next year to put the old \"zip\" on the ball. Frank Harris (Guard) \u2014 Frank did more than his share of rebounding. Many an opposing player will verify that Harris handled the ball well, and could be depended upon to bring it across the line. He should be in there fighting next year Wesley Srelzriede \"Wes\" could always be counted upon to put his best in a game He always ap- peared calm and handled the ball well He certainly snagged a great many re- bounds and more than one of his well- placed shots helped to boost the score Don Broadway (Forward) \u2014 Don was death on side shots He added many a point to the team's score. His ball handling was excellent, and if was not uncommon to see him \"break-through\" and \"loop\" another in for the Bearcats. Arthur Kleinschmidr (Center) \u2014 Art, a second year letterman, the tallest on the team, used his height to great advantage His rebounding ability was of great value to the team. He was one of the leading scorers, and was strictly a team man He will be the main cog in the Bearcats' machine next year. Louis Purcell Although Purcell was a member of the Bearcats only in the early part of the season, he added many points to the score Always under the basket for re- bounds, and couid be depended upon to handle the ball well. He was calm at all times. BASKETBALL LETTERMEN (No Picture) (Continued) Fred Brink (Forward) \u2014 An excellent substitute, Fred, one of the fastest players on the floor, could be counted upon to put plenty of the \"old drive\" in the game Brink should be an important cog in the Bear- cat line-up next year.

The plot revolves around the Burgess family the day before Christmas, preparing to spend their Christmas day without their son, Johnny, who is working in Chicago, and Grandpa, who had died the preceding summer. The typical family re- actions are found: sixteen-year-old Julie falling in love for the first time; eighteen-year-old Emily receiving a proposal, and the twelve-year- old Janet discovering the real meaning or Christmas. The climax comes with the arrival of Johnny, who has been given the day off to spend Christmas at home. The play was directed by the Reverend F. C. Stelzriede.

Along with being May Queen, she held the position of editor of the McKendrean. \"Curb,\" who is a graduate of the class of '45, has taken part in many of the campus activities. Cooperation and cheerfulness are two of her attributes that rank her as a popular student on the \"Old Hill.\" Ruth was crowned during the May Fete by her Maid of Honor, Shirley Bergman HOME-COMI NG QUEEN \"From freshman to senior, brunette to blonde, beauty to beauty, youth to youth, I present to you the Home-coming Queen, Ruth Cooper.\" Thus, as Ruth was handed the bouquet of roses, she was proclaimed the Home-coming Queen of 1944. \"Coopie\" seems to be following in the footsteps of her big sister, Dolores, who was crowned queen in 1940. She is one of our Fine Arts students majoring in Voice. Ruth has been active in extra-curricular activities.

CLASS HISTORIES THE CLASS OF '45 The thirty-six members of our class who approached McKendree campus on September 7, 1942, were a distinguished looking group. Each was an individual in himself, and each had a different idea about college life. We were all eager for a college education combined with a little fun to make our studying more interesting. We ate regularly at meals and traveled the PC. Trail to town for our irregular meals. Our class is the last one to remember the old trail. It seems a pity, for it was such a short cut, especially when one was sipping a coke at Doc's when the bell rang for the next class. The hayride was quite an event. Everyone wore old clothes and stuffed their pockets with three or four hot dogs. The \"Y\" Mixer proved to be quite a success, although there were several who had sore arms the next day because they shook too many hands. Then we had the Hallowe'en party in the gym. The Conference at Alton was a big event. Everyone seemed to be in a gay mood that day. Miss Ridgway had a little difficulty in packing the car, but Clifford Brown came to the rescue. Now let us turn the pages of our memory book until we reach our Freshman Picnic. It seemed we weren't successful in ringing the Chapel Bell, although \"Bill\" Stallings made a good attempt at it when he fell down the fire escape, trying to escape from the upperclassmen. On Initiation Night the girls had a little trouble too. Several jumped over Behymer's hedge in order to be hidden from the view of the upperclassmen who drove by in the college truck. You ask about Home-coming? Of course, we were the first freshman class to start a tradition. We had the first Formal Freshman Chapel Program. The girls wore their lovely formals and the boys wore their best suits. We really tried to impress the upperclassmen. The next day, Plato and Phi lo played their last game, with a score of 50-33 in favor of Plato. Shirley Bergman was crowned Home-coming Queen at the game. Shirley was the first freshman ever to be crowned queen. About this time some angels in Clark Hall had a hair-pulling and nail-scratch- ing fight. Soda bottles were stacked against dorm doors, chewing gum was thrown freely and as a result, a few people changed their place of habitation. Miss \"D\" had her trying moments with our class, but she seemed to keep us in hand by a persistent knocking on the steam pipes. The war was in its prime while we were freshmen and I'm sure we all realized the fact. Our first blackout was an experience to remember. We sat calmly listen- ing to the roar of airplane motors overhead while all lights were extinguished. The Beechnut Buddies serenaded us with Christmas carols and \"My Gal Sal.\" The kitchen force was a very prominent crew. Each was bestowed with a dif- ferent talent and each tried to portray his talents on the food. They seemed to work well together, for I remember only a few fights. However, when things became too wild the pantry was the best place in which to lock them. Then came Senior Day, when two boys with tear-stained cheeks and faltering steps marched down the aisle and presented the school with two beautiful flags. With this memory is linked the memory of the dedication of the service flag, and the song, \"My Buddy.\" These were just two sad incidents that have made up our war-time education. Oh yes, how could we ever forget those summer courses and the way we used to slave over those hard subjects with perspiration trickling down our brow? How- ever, when Preachers School and Institute came around it was sweat that flowed from our brow. It was during summer school that we all witnessed the experience with the soldier who was supposed to have been a mental case who escaped from Scott Field. A suggestion was made to have the Carnegie Hall boys protect us, but the girls decided they could take care of themselves if all windows and doors were locked and beds moved to third floor. It was the same summer we had so much trouble over the water cooler. Our class has been scattered to the four corners of the earth because of the war and the accelerated program. There will be only fifteen members wearing caps and gowns and receiving their degrees on Commencement Day. We have learned a great deal from Old McK. We have learned how to live and, most of all, how to appreciate a college degree. THE CLASS OF '46 We registered at McKendree College, as the class of '46, one bright, sunny morning in September, 1942 \u2014 a very scared group of young people. Yes, we all lived in mortal terror until that frightful day of initiation was over. For us, it was either a lovely baptism in the beautiful lagoon on McKendree's back campus, or a very refreshing, brisk walk 'neath the stars to the college, from some unspecified point in Illinois. A few unfortunates suffered both. However, initiation rules did not bother us. To be truthful, we were quite proud to don the green caps. Most of us actually submitted to initiation quite peacefully. Admittedly, a year or two of college provides one with the knack of improving on unpromising material, and so, notwithstanding the few authentic scrimmages with the gentlemen (and ladies) of the three wiser years, we, of late, find our- selves relating to the new and unsuspecting freshmen just how successful we were in our vicious and recalcitrant attitude to any and all things related to the upper- classmen and initiation. Like all war classes, ours is not an exception, for through the weeks, months, and even years, many members of the class of '46 heeded the call of war. Today they may be found on any far-flung battlefield. Some were claimed by war, and sleep the eternal sleep. It is to them that we especially dedicate our undying thanks; for them our pride knows no bounds. With us they shall tread the Centen- nial path in caps and gowns. The class of '46 is a proud class, indeed. We feel quite assured that it will provide another strong link in the long chain of McKendree years. THE CLASS OF '47 Though ours is one of the smallest classes to enroll in McK. during this war- time period, we have, nevertheless, filled our position in the campus activities. Starting with only twenty-five members we proceeded to fit our lives into the col- lege program. Our picnic was the usual failure, but we en|oyed our rations (three or four potato chips and a quarter of a cup-cake are rations, aren't they ? ) free from molesting upperclassmen. A class of '47 skating party for the school has come to be a tradition. Most of our class has taken advantage of the accelerated program offered by the school. We leave these two years behind, not forgetting \"the dean's\" English Comp. class, Mode and Pete taking top honors in the \"Dorris,\" midnight snacks, and the biology trip to Missouri. Memories of the past make goals for the future. We're proud of McK. and hope we can make her proud of us. THE CLASS OF '48 When we, the class of '48, enrolled as freshmen at McKendree College last September, we were just as green and scared as the average freshmen. With green hats flying, we were chased many miles before dodging the upper- classmen during our initiation \u2014 a night long to be remembered by us all. Our officers for the year were Don Broadway, president; Eunice Hanbaura vice- president; and Elizabeth Crisp, secretary-treasurer. We are justly proud of our Freshman Basketball Team, for they remained unde- feated throughout the entire season. Also, we displayed our talents at the annual Formal Freshman Chapel Program. We, the Freshman Class, have enjoyed this year on the \"Old Hill\" and are eagerly looking forward to three more years at McKendree. 33 i!l $ n \"Bug\" Trip Time Out 1 She Has a MAN Dummies?

Broadway Elementary School, located in Venice, serves 257 kindergarten-sixth grade students. It is the second dual English-Mandarin program to be offered in the LAUSD, and the only one on the west side.\nThe UCLA Confucius Institute, in partnership with the Department of Asian Language and Cultures, began a Mandarin program at Broadway Elementary last fall for all students in grades K-6. Those students received 30 minutes of Mandarin, four times a week. Based on the success of this program, LAUSD Superintendent Cortines gave the school the go-ahead to start an Immersion Program. This is a very exciting development for our community and a unique opportunity for our children. Broadway is located on Lincoln Blvd. in Venice, and is accepting students from all over the region.\nPlease tell your friends about the program and encourage them to contact the school for more information:\nBroadway Elementary School\n1015 Lincoln Blvd. Venice, CA 90291\nPhone: (310)392-4944 Fax: (310)314-7349\nSusan Wang, Principal Email:\nPublished: Tuesday, July 06, 2010", "label": 0}

Our responders need to do better to protect kids particularly when dangerous incidents happen adjacent to a school at the time school lets out.

{"text": "|Reviews for Decode\n| Guest chapter 20 . 12/28/2012\nBeginning is amazing! One of the best ive ever read. However I think the end of the middle needs some work. Their breakup should be more serious and Sean should not be so begging whilst trying to get him back. Because of holden being with the other guy you kind of think he is the douchey one, and the fact that he keeps messing saun around.\n| Daryl chapter 14 . 4/4/2012\nOh My FUCKing GOD! Your fic is sooo good. When i heard there was a gay story arc in Valentine's Day, i watched it and loved it. ALthough i think they didn't put enough of a gay storyline in the movie. That's why i've been trolling recently. Im currently shipping Sean/Holden. So far i think you have written the best drama period! I love the plot. It's like a tv show. and the characters really come to life. Im also glad you juggle well OCs and the canon characters. I guess im just a sucker for high school au's seriously, this is soo good. I haven't finished it yet because i have to go to bed now for school tomorrow. Thankk You so much for blessing the internet with this phenomenal fanfiction. i dont want it to end...\n| slaxl chapter 20 . 2/6/2012\nThis was such a cute story. I loved it. I wish they had done more with the characters in the movie, they were to most interesting in my opinion. This was a nice AU, even though I rarely go for those, I really thought this was well-written. I enjoyed you adding Channing Tatum to the mix, lol. Again, nice story and great job!\n| akerri.dogi chapter 2 . 1/5/2012\nI saw Easy A! Fun movie! :)\n| JtheChosen1 chapter 20 . 10/7/2011\nKickass story here! Loved reading it and you made an awesome AU with everyone!\n| Karallaye chapter 20 . 7/4/2011\nAww, that was so sweet! (I just graduated from High School, so it was interesting-if a bit sad-to read that last bit) I really liked how it all came together by the end.\nI have to tell you, that the reason why I sometimes don't like High School fics, is because the story arc usually moves so much, that the characters become their own beings, instead of just portraying the movie characters. I feel like that happened a bit here, but I liked the way you worked everything out.\nAwesome job!\n| Karallaye chapter 6 . 7/2/2011\nDun Dun Dun DUN! What's Harrison got to say now? And-Fuckin' Reed... I was liking him! A lot! You're evil, :D\n| Karallaye chapter 5 . 7/2/2011\nGoblet of Fire is my favorite too!\n| Karallaye chapter 4 . 7/2/2011\nOh this was going so swimmingly. But then stupid Kelvin. But Yay for Reed being so awesome! (Well, he's Ashton Kutcher, so he has to be, but still- high five!) Poor Holden.\n| Karallaye chapter 2 . 7/2/2011\nawww... Poor holden :( But it makes sense that Sean would react that way.\n| Karallaye chapter 1 . 7/2/2011\nI like this first bit. I wasn't sure if I would like the High School scenario, but I guess Sean's own drama and anxiety about his sexuality is probably at about the same stage as it was in the movie.

{"text": "UnReviews:Bush memoir\nFrom Uncyclopedia, the content-free encyclopedia\nedit By Michael Jordan (No, not the basketball player)\nedit The Washington Post\nWhen I first heard that former president George W. Bush was writing a memoir, I laughed my tush off. No way in hell could this man write a book; he couldn't even run a country, for Christ's sake! Whoever voted for this guy either year should be lined up and shot.\nSo I finally got my hands on My Memwarz, formerly titled Decision Points (or Deesizhun Poynts) before Bush gave up on spelling the title. It's so obvious that its publication was a tad rushed... and the evidence is in the cover. This book gives paperback a whole new meaning. My Memwarz was written in crayon and paint, and on wrinkled doodle paper. There are staples on the side, but the middle one is out of alignment. It took me a half hour to remove it so that I could read the book for this review. And you would think a 64-year-old former president would at least be able to spell his name correctly, or is he just now revealing that he is secretly Hispanic? Jorge W. Bush? Really? \u00a1Excelente! All hail President Hor-hay! Kind or ironic considering Bush's stance on immigration and illegal aliens. \u00a1Ay, caramba! Not since \"Shcool\" (or Dan Quayle) have I seen such horrid spelling. Let's move on, shall we.\nThe \"Tabol uv Kontents\" was a total mess. Not just the spelling and \"typographical\" errors, but some chapters pointed to the wrong page numbers. You're going to have better luck finding your way through the Bible or the phone book.\nThe first three pages of the book are literally taken from the Dr. Seuss classic Green Eggs and Ham glued onto the respective pages. Unfortunately, he cannot be sued because both books were published by Random House.\nBush further infringes copyright when some of his college recollections read like scenes from the John Belushi classic, Animal House. For example, he recalls when he, brother Jeb, and their \"maternity brothers\" got drunk one night and started chanting \"Toga! Toga! Toga!\" for no apparent reason. Bush then chronicles the time he and his fellow students sat down for lunch and he smashed the food out of his mouth and told them that he was a zit.\nIt gets worse when his retelling of 9/11 involves aliens blowing up the White House and Bush describing himself as looking like \"either Bill Paxton or Bill Pullman.\" Not once does he mention terrorists, Osama bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, or Al-Qaeda, though the centerfold of the 512-page book is a maze of Iraq.\nSurprisingly, he doesn't write too much about his presidency, reportedly because he couldn't figure out how to spell \"presidency.\" However, he does note that he liked impersonators such as Will Ferrell, Timothy Bottoms, and \"Frank Kallie Endo.\" He says he is glad he is out of Washington so that he no longer has to worry about pretending to think and make decisions. Now, it's unanimous, as David Letterman has noted.\nBush describes the first time he met Laura in Forks, Washington. She was a human and the Bushes, led by \"Mommy\" and \"Daddy\", were a coven of vampires. Thus proving that the former president is desperate to top the New York Times Bestseller List.\nChapter 6 is nothing but photos of Bush getting drunk, eating chips, and mooning people in his college \"materinity.\" You'd think somebody had told him that the word is \"fraterinity.\"\nThe former president writes positively (as well as typographically and illegibly) about rival Kanye West and the latter's comments that the former \"Doesn't care about black people.\" Bush writes (sic, by the way):\n|Konyay West iz 1 hapinin homeey. I do not apruve uv wut hee sed about blaque pee pole, but that wuz then end this iz now. I fergiv him, and we r now best budz.\nIn Chapter 2, Bush writes about meeting Vladimir Putin and his dog. He describes the pet as \"bigger, stronger, and faster than Barney. I mean, seriously, whoever wehrs that purple dynasor costoom kant run to sayv hiz lyf.\" In this chapter, he expresses his deep admiration for the PBS dinosaur. He even claims that he named his dog Barney after the character.\nThe book tells Bush's life out of sequence, much like a Quentin Tarantino film, and it was quite hard to follow Bush's biography. I was about to champion Bush's gonzo journalism, give the book a perfect five-star rating, and proclaim him the next Hunter S. Thompson... until I realized he was being serious. The novelty wore off and I cannot recommend this book to anyone, except for comedians and political pundits looking for a cheap shot.\nAnd don't let the hardcover version fool you, either. It's more of the same, except with a more professional build and cover, as well as the original (correctly spelled) title, Decision Points.\nThis article is part of Uncyclopedia's UnReviews series. See more UnReviews\nThis subject is 0 out of 5 stars!\nThat's a giant pile of shit!", "label": 0}

{"text": "Efficiency is one reason we are able to give you the best price. Files that you send must meet certain requirements in order to be printed at the best quality and price. The requirements are outlined below. Failure to adhere to them will result in additional charges.\nWhen laying out your file please use one of the following applications or supply us a high res .pdf document which includes bleed and live area as outlined below.\n- QuarkXPress\n- Adobe InDesign\n- Adobe Illustrator\n- Adobe Photoshop\nDocument Size\nStandard business card size is 3.5 x 2. Standard postcard sizes are 4 x 6, 5 x 7, and 6 x 9. Please set your document sizes accordingly. Avoid floating a business card or postcard on an 8.5 x 11 page.\nBleed is the area outside the trim area of a document in which graphical elements are printed. This area is then trimmed off, resulting in color going all the way to edge of the piece. If you didn't bleed elements and instead placed them up to the boundaries of the trim area, irregularities encountered during cutting might produce a piece where a thin line of un printed stock shows along one of more edges. And that could ruin the overall effectiveness of the card's design. There are separate prices for bleed and non-bleed business cards. Standard bleed is 1/8 inch. If you are designing a non-bleed card, a good practice is to keep all elements at least 1/8 inch from the edge of the card.\nScanning Issues\nYou should scan all images at 300 dpi at the size they are going to be used. Line art images and text should be scanned at least 600 dpi at the size they are going to be used. All color scans should be CMYK and should be in TIFF or EPS format. If you do not have access to a scanner, you can design your card with a placeholder for the picture and have us scan the picture for a fee.\nFull color printing is generally done with only four colors; cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. CMYK is just another way to say process, or full color, printing. All elements to be printed must be separated into the four color channels. Scanned color images are RGB.\nSpot or PMS Colors\nWe offer additional spot colors from the standard PMS swatch selections, including metallic. However, spot or additional colors may increase your pricing.\nSending Files\nThe easiest way to get your files to us is to compress and FTP them directly. Alternately, you may send us your files on a CD/DVD or a flash drive.\nCompressing Files\nGather your layout file and all associated files (scans, clip art, fonts, etc.) into a folder. Then use Stuffit or WinZip or a similar compression program to archive the entire folder.\nI need cards but I can't design them myself. Can you help?\nYes.

Usually, most individuals have a major question on buying a travel book. So here are the pros and cons of purchasing one such book.\nAdvantages of a Travel Book\nA travel book, which may be a paperback or e-book, comes in handy while traveling. Glancing through a travel book enables you to understand the custom and culture of a particular place in the world. So you can adapt yourself to that particular environment and stay there comfortably for longer periods.\n- They Come In Handy \u2014 The travel guide comes in various forms such as, e-books, paperbacks and the file formats. You can have easy access to these books, which would assist you with all details compatible to the region you are traveling to.\n- They Provide Enormous Information \u2014 Electronic or traditional travel guides provide you with answers to all types of questions such as how to learn some sayings that can be used in the place where you are traveling to? How to get data on where to reside, what to see and where to eat? How to get a clear knowledge about the history of a specific region or the atmosphere that it has?\n- They Suit To Your Requirements \u2014 To access full information about a specific country or a region, both types of general and specific travel books are made available. The e-book may easily fit into your e-book reader whereas the paperback can fit into your backpack.\nDisadvantages of Travel Book\n- The Price \u2014 The e-book and paperback travel guides are very expensive compared to the information obtained from travel websites or from those who have moved or traveled to that region.\n- Qualitative Images In Travel Books \u2014 Most travel books are in black and white. Only a few e-books consist of colored photos. Hence make a thorough revision before purchasing a travel guide or an e-book.\n- Travel Books Make The Trip Less Natural \u2014 Traveling can be made more spontaneous by acquiring suggestions from locals than from travel books.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Chapter 13 bankruptcy is an interest-free repayment plan that allows you to combine your debts and repay all or part of them while protecting you from creditor harassment. It is an excellent alternative for debtors in Oregon and Washington whose financial problems cannot be helped by a Chapter 7. It often provides much greater protection to debtors who own significant assets or have income that would not be exempt in a Chapter 7. For example, if you own a home and foreclosure is on the horizon, or the finance company has threatened repossession, a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy filing will stop them in their tracks and you can then pay off the back balance gradually. Chapter 13 bankruptcy in Oregon and Washington is also a great option when you have a regular income but you still find yourself unable to pay all your bills at the end of the month.\nDo I qualify?\nIn order to qualify for a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy, you will need to meet two general income requirements. First, you must have a regular source of income. Second, you must have sufficient disposable income. Put another way, you must have at least some income left over to distribute to creditors after you subtract your living expenses from your net monthly income.\nHow does it work?\nThere are specific and complex procedures involved in filing a Chapter 13 plan. First, your lawyer will need to prepare a detail financial summary of what and whom you owe, what your assets are, your monthly living expenses and income. Your attorney must also prepare a comprehensive proposal for repayment. Often a plan will call for different percentages of repayment for different classes of creditors. All of the items submitted must be prepared on court approved forms.\nOnce you file your petition and plan, the court will issue an Automatic Stay order, barring all creditors from taking any further collections or legal action against you, including foreclosure or garnishment. The court will set a date for a hearing. This hearing is called the \u2018Meeting of Creditors.\u2019 You and your creditors will be notified of the time, date and place of this meeting, and you will be required to attend this hearing with your attorney and answer questions under oath about your financial matters.\nThe trustee appointed in your case will run the meeting. It is the trustee\u2019s job to verify that the financial information you give. The trustee will then decide whether he can recommend to the judge that your plan be confirmed. At the meeting, the trustee may question you about your income, expenses, property, past earnings and the schedule of repayment.\nThe court will also notify you of the date of the confirmation hearing. At the confirmation hearing, the judge will determine whether your plan should be confirmed and allowed to proceed. The creditors may attend this hearing and offer any objections they may have. Your presence at the confirmation hearing is often not required. Once your plan is confirmed, you will simply make one payment a month to the trustee who will make payments to your creditors according to the schedule set out in the plan. You will start living your life again.\nWhat will Chapter 13 Bankruptcy do for me?\nMany of the benefits derived from a Chapter 13 bankruptcy cannot be obtained through the filing of a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy. Some of the many benefits that may be reaped from a Chapter 13 bankruptcy are as follows:\n- You can stop a finance company from repossessing your car and make the back\npayments over a period of time.\n- You can stop foreclosure proceedings against your property and pay off the\nback balance gradually. Such an extension is also available on back taxes.\n- If your monthly payments on contracts are too large, you may be able to\nlower the monthly payment and possibly the interest rate.\n- Depending on your circumstances, you may be able to pay the unsecured\ncreditors far less than 100% of their claims with no interest after the date of\n- In most instances, you can stop any more interest from continuing on\nunsecured debts.\n- You may be able to keep property that would have otherwise been given to your creditors in a Chapter 7.\n- You may be able to stop collection activities against a person who cosigned\na loan for you.\n- You might be able to force a creditor to take back its collateral in full\nsatisfaction of the claim.\n- You can end further obligations to creditors whose services you have not\nfully received, such as from health clubs, dance studios, correspondence\ncourses, leases, etc.\n- For debts incurred before you filed your bankruptcy petition, no one can\nbother you, sue you, garnish your wages, or repossess property without court\n- You may be able to void certain liens against your household goods and\nagainst some other personal items.\n- You can sometimes pay extra into the plan to get it paid off sooner.\n- If there is a major change of circumstances, you can propose changes to your\nplan that would help you complete it.\nHow do I get started?\nThe first step in the process is finding an experienced bankruptcy attorney.\nConsidering the complexity of Chapter 13 itself and the further complications offered by the upcoming changes in the bankruptcy laws, you want to find someone who specializes only in bankruptcy. Because bankruptcy law is based largely on state law and exemptions, you want to find a lawyer that specializes in your state.\nIn contrast to many large volume bankruptcy firms found across the internet and yellow pages, when you call Pacific Bankruptcy you will not reach a call center in Chicago or a paralegal in Philadelphia. You will reach an Oregon or Washington attorney directly. You will most likely reach the attorney who will be putting your plan together, representing you at your confirmation hearing or dealing with your creditors.\nAt Pacific Bankruptcy, we realize that many of our clients need help finding all their creditors. To that end, we obtain credit reports for our clients at cost. Finally, while we welcome the opportunity to meet face to face with all our clients, we know that for many of them, free time is a luxury that they have long since learned to live without. Understanding this, we\u2019ve set up systems and trained attorneys to accommodate the needs of clients who cannot get over to our offices.\nMore than anything, we look forward to helping you get a fresh start so that you can start living your life again.

{"text": "September 28, 2022 [Reuters] \u2013 U.S. oil refinery utilization rates, a measure of how operators view future fuel demand, could top 90% next quarter for the third consecutive period, industry analysts projected, reflecting scant stocks and strong demand for diesel.\nHistorically, utilization rates fall in the fourth quarter as refiners begin winter maintenance and motor fuel consumption slips after U.S. summer driving season ends. This year\u2019s final quarter, however, could see operators hold production rates high to grab strong diesel margins, they said.\nThe forecast excludes the potential impact of a major hurricane striking the U.S. Gulf Coast, home of nearly half the nation\u2019s oil refining. It also excludes unplanned refinery outages or a possible deep economic recession that cuts demand, analysts said.\nRefiners will avoid a direct hit by Hurricane Ian, which is taking aim at Florida.\n\u201cLower gasoline cracks have pulled refining margins down in recent weeks, but overall margins are still quite attractive,\u201d said Matthew Blair, head of refining research at energy specialist Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. \u201cWe would expect 90% or higher barring a major hurricane,\u201d he added.\nLatest Updates\nOil prices down 1.5% for the week on recession jitters. Dutch government lifts filling target for Bergermeer gas storage facility to 90%\nOverall U.S. utilization \u2013 the amount of oil processed compared to a plant\u2019s rated capacity \u2013 was above 92% and 93%, respectively, in the second and third quarters this year, he said. The first quarter averaged 89.5%.\nProfit margins this year have been very strong, but have cooled with declines in gasoline consumption. The margin from selling diesel from a barrel of oil and replacing that barrel, called the diesel crack spread, this week was about $54 per barrel on the Gulf Coast, compared to about $12 a year ago, according to Refinitiv.\nRefinery operators have run at high levels this year in part due to capacity losses from plant closures during the Coronavirus pandemic. U.S. crude oil capacity is down nearly 1 million barrels per day since early 2020, to 17.9 million barrels per day (bpd).\nDemand in Europe has made diesel supplies tighter globally, said John Auers, managing director of Refined Fuels Analytics, part of consultancy RBN Energy.\n\u201cDiesel margins will be higher, Auers said. \u201cI think that will be pushing refining margins.\u201d\nU.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm in August wrote to refiners Valero Energy , Chevron (CVX.N) and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) asking they reduce product exports and build U.S. fuel supplies, citing \u201chistorically low levels of gasoline and diesel in parts of the country.\u201d\nHowever, exports of distillate, primarily diesel, soared to 1.76 million bpd in the week ended Sept. 16, from 579,000 bpd a year earlier. At the same time, inventories fell to 117.3 million barrels, down 12 million barrels from the same week a year ago.\nWorries over tighter diesel supply are boosting refinery runs, said Robert Yawger, director of energy futures at Mizuho.\n\u201cRefiners are worried about the distillate situation being at multi-year lows,\u201d Yawger said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to make more distillate.\u201d\nHolding runs above 90% runs the risk of further eroding gasoline margins. About 46% of a barrel of oil is processed into gasoline and only 27% to diesel.\nU.S. gasoline stocks rose by 1.6 million barrels in the week ended Sept. 16 to 214.6 million barrels, the EIA said.\nDiesel output could jump next year as Exxon completes a 250,000 bpd oil-processing expansion to its Beaumont, Texas, refinery. Offsetting that, LyondellBasell Industries\u2019s (LYB.N) plans to permanently close its 263,776 bpd Houston refinery by the end of 2023.\nPro Trial: Access 11,340 Tank Terminal and Production Facilities\n11,340 tank storage and production facilities as per the date of this article.

{"text": "28 Nov Midwest is key player for Biofuels industry\nI have to admit that I was pretty ignorant about the whole topic of biofuels until I helped organize a recent iBIO (www.ibio.org) event on this topic.\nWhile assembling the speakers helped illuminate me, it was really not until I sat through their combined presentations and listened to some of the excellent Q&A that I really felt somewhat knowledgeable on the subject.\nOf course the case for biofuels, or renewable energy, is compelling given the recent ramp-up of the cost of gasoline in the U.S., which quickly more than doubled from well under $2 per gallon to over $3 per gallon and heading to $4 per gallon as a result of the impact of the recent battery of hurricanes on Louisiana and Texas, where an important part of the U.S.\u2019s oil refinery business is located. Now that the supply crisis seems to be momentarily resolved, in part due to the federal government\u2019s decision to release some of its U.S. strategic stockpile oil reserves, the price at the pump of gas has rolled back to the $2.20 \u2013 $2.45 per gallon range. Previously, we used to be mortified at this price level; now it seems cheap after pushing past the $3 per gallon level.\nQuite frankly, we are pampered here in the U.S. Anyone who has done any traveling around the world would know that the U.S. price for gas is artificially low. In most European countries, gas ranges from $4-6 per gallon or more.\nThe biofuels event at Bradley University in Peoria featured an interesting array of panelists including representatives from:\n\u2022 Exxon Mobil\n\u2022 Illinois Corn Growers Association (corn is the main ingredient used for ethanol while soybean is the main ingredient used for biodiesel)\n\u2022 Argonne National Labs (Energy Systems division)\n\u2022 University of Illinois/Champaign-Urbana (Institute for Genomic Biology)\n\u2022 U.S. Department of Agriculture (National Center for Agriculture Utilization Research)\n\u2022 CSX Corp. (the railroad company)\nAn initial presentation by Exxon Mobil which forecast oil growth and needs until the year 2030 shows that the world currently consumes about 240 million barrels of energy daily. From the period 1980 to 2003, world energy growth requirements grew an average 1.6 percent each year. This growth is projected to increase slightly from 2003 to 2030, to about 1.7 percent growth each year, reaching about 340 million barrels daily of energy consumption.\nCurrently, about 50% of the world\u2019s energy needs are supplied by oil, with the remaining energy requirements coming from natural gas, coal, and other sources. The \u201cother\u201d category currently represents about 45 million barrels of energy daily, and is expected to grow to 60 million barrels daily by 2030. The \u201cother\u201d energy category includes:\n\u2022 Hydro\n\u2022 Nuclear (holding pretty steady)\n\u2022 Wind & Solar (the smallest area)\n\u2022 Biomass (the largest area representing about 60% of the \u201cother\u201d category)\nBiomass, in case this term is unfamiliar to you, is the use of crops (corn, soybean, etc.) to create fuels.\nPerhaps another way to look at energy consumption, in a manner that we can all relate to, is the growth of automobile use:\nFuel Consumption for Cars \u2013 Major Regions\nThe above chart is somewhat mind-blowing. Look at some of these trends:\n\u2022 It is hard to believe that the U.S. car market, which one would have thought as already highly saturated, will grow another 38% over the next 27 years, versus only 17% in Europe and almost 10 fold in Asia Pacific (mostly fueled by China and countries such as Thailand and Indonesia); it also shows how much we (the U.S.) are, and will remain, a car-dominated society.\n\u2022 Although U.S. fuel efficiency will improve, it is still substantially behind Europe, and surprisingly remains very low in spite of the growth of the hybrid segment.\n\u2022 The Europeans seem to have managed their growth in a reasonable manner, most likely due to the high price of gas, and generally excellent mass transport.\nIn the U.S. today, it is frequent to find that most gas we purchase at the pump has some ethanol content (from between 10-15%), which in general is derived from corn. In fact, 78% of the gas sold in Illinois contains 10% ethanol, according to the Illinois Corn Growers Association. Given that Illinois is one of the top states in the U.S. for corn production, and the Midwest has the highest concentration of both corn and soy production, there is a tremendous amount of biomass available for conversion into biofuels.\nThere are currently three ethanol production centers in Illinois up and running, but there are another 14 in the works which would mean that Illinois would have 17 ethanol production centers in the near future.\nIllinois currently exports 41% of its corn crop to other countries, with another 11% exported to other states; the remaining corn is used for feed and biomass, and other processing. It would appear that the use of corn as biomass for renewable fuels garners a higher price than currently obtained via exports, which raises the question of whether Illinois farmers would be better off rechanneling these sales to biofuels. The problem would appear to be, at the moment, the lack of ethanol biorefineries.\nA similar case could be also made for soybeans which is the basis for biodiesel with a couple of other complicating factors:\n\u2022 The U.S. car market mostly uses gas and not diesel (this is contrary to Europe where a much greater use of diesel is used), except for trucks\n\u2022 The cost to produce biodiesel is apparently still high, so improvements on reducing costs in this area are needed for this to be competitive on a world level with regular diesel.\nSome food for thought: the Illinois corn crop from 2004 was 12 % higher than the record crop of 2003 so there are still \u201cpiles\u201d of corn around. The 2005 crop, while not as good as 2004, was still pretty high in yield, resulting in further \u201cpiles\u201d.\nTraditionally, some of the arguments against biofuels have been:\n\u2022 The cost of creating theses fuels is much higher than traditional petroleum exploration, production and refining.\n\u2022 More energy is needed to create a BTU of biofuel than biofuel itself produces.\nHowever, these arguments have fallen by the wayside due to:\n\u2022 The impact of biotechnology on crop yield productivity\n\u2022 Improved biomass refinery methods\n\u2022 The significant increase in the price of oil\n\u2022 The continued rise in oil needs in the U.S. and the reliance on oil imports particularly from countries at odds with the U.S. (Venezuela, Iran, etc.)\nEthanol production from biomass (corn) has grown about 20% per year reaching about 280,000 barrels a day, up from 120,000 barrels a day in 2001 and 10,000 barrels a day in 1980. Current forecasts are that 2012, ethanol production from biomass will double to 560,000 barrels a day, and eventually reach 3.5 million barrels a day.\nBut the new biorefineries in the Midwest will not only produce fuels, but chemicals, polymers, and consumer products.\nThe Department of Energy is providing incentives for this trend and has set a goal that by 2020:\n\u2022 10% of transportation fuel will be supplied by biomass.\n\u2022 biopower will supply 5% of industrial and utility power demands\n\u2022 biomass-derived chemicals and materials will account for 18% of U.S. targeted chemicals\nIt is believed by a number of scientists, that U.S. crops could eventually supply all U.S. transportation fuel needs: 1.3 billion tons of biomass equals 130 billion gallons of ethanol (according to Argonne scientists). The Midwest is uniquely positioned in the U.S. to capture this biomass/renewable fuels market.\nBut biotechnology could yield even further improvements in the area of biofuels through the development of butanol from corn, which is a superior fuel replacement/extender, as butanol has higher energy content than ethanol. Additionally butanol has storage advantages and can be used not only in internal combustion engines but in diesel engines, and is essentially non-polluting.\nButanol production can be further enhanced via the utilization of a micro-organism known as C. beijerinckii. The genome of this organism was sequenced by the Department of Energy\u2019s Joint Genome Institute and the determination of gene functions is currently underway, but it is believed that this organism can produce higher butanol yields.\nFood processing giant ADM recently announced the acquisition of biodiesel production facilities in North Dakota, and it would hardly be surprising to see this company and companies such as Cargill moving into this field in an aggressive manner.\nWhat is surprising is that the traditional oil companies do not see biofuels as their bailiwick, as their business model is based on the discovery and extraction of oil from various sources around the earth. The biofuel companies of the future may well be the food processing giants which are already used to extracting end products from crop waste products. Once again, the Midwest is uniquely positioned here with some of the largest food processing companies in the world.\nStill another reason that the Midwest has a strategic advantage in this area is the fact that ethanol production, produced most abundantly in the Midwest, would be carried to the rest of the U.S. via rail. Most of the major rail lines all come through Chicago and the Midwest. The railroads are not only seeing the increase in ethanol production, but responding to it by creating new rail lines from the source of production to major sites on the east and west coasts. Additionally these railroads themselves are big consumers of biofuels.\nThe concept of biofuels is a fascinating story. If the U.S. would just raise the price of gas to provide further incentives for increasing efforts to improve biofuel development and reduce reliance on non-U.S. fuel imports (and reduce gas consumption), the U.S. could see significant growth in this new industry", "label": 1}

Be aware!\nHere is what I suggest:\n- Be curious and have good conversations to explore their perspective\n- Instead of a fast judgment, try to understand what\u2019s important for them and why\n- Explore how you can help and support each other\n- Discover together how to bring more meaning (doing good / contribution) and work-life balance into the workplace\n- Allow them to be creative and listen to what they have to say\nOur young generation isn\u2019t wired to stay in a job for life and if they do, you must treat them extraordinary well or they will move back into their parents\u2019 basement.\nThey have observed their parents losing their job after 20+ years and this could also be the reason why they don\u2019t believe in loyalty. They rather go for enjoying life than working their rear end off with little to no appreciation.\nMaybe, just maybe, we can learn a thing or two from them.\nSpeak Your Mind", "label": 1}
{"text": "Using Safari on Intel Macbook pro OSX10.6.8 I can access my online banking with HSBC HK no problem. When viewing bank statements (that are viewable in their entirety within a popup window) I will usually press command+P >> PDF >> save as PDF to download and save an offline copy. However, I noticed that the last 3 mths of statements that I downloaded only show part of the statement, the part that was actually on my screen at the time I saved it (just like a screen cap), even if that means the pdf will save half of one page and half of the next i.e. it is not printing 1 page out of 3. Prior to the 3 mths there was not an issue. I tried again and always got the same results, also if I just tried to print and not save as pdf same issue. The print preview shows the \"screen cap\" not the whole document. I assume it has something to do with the pop up window and how it relates to the safari print command. HSBC had no solution. Any ideas?", "label": 1}
{"text": "Hello From The Hug!\n(March 2008)\nG\u2019day all! Well, another month has passed and I\u2019m actually on time with the newsletter this month! Yay me!! (perhaps it\u2019s because I\u2019m counting down to my birthday!!!) Things have been VERY hectic at the Tag Along Teddies hug, so I thought I\u2019d take advantage of a quieter day to write the newsletter before someone reminds me of a job I\u2019ve forgotten \u2013 or lures me out for a cuppa!! Tee! Hee! Hee!\nLet\u2019s see \u2026 the biggest excitement for this last month has been the addition of Tag Along Teddies stitchery patterns to the range available at Quilter\u2019s World patchwork shop here in Toowoomba. I popped in to buy some fabric for borders for a new project (more about that later in the newsletter!!) and got chatting with shop owner, Pauline Rogers. Pauline has been involved in quilting, patchwork and craft for many years and after making some changes to her business, was looking for some new stitchery patterns to add to her wonderfully extensive range which is available on line as well as in her magnificent store. And she fell in love with some of my stitched teddies \u2013 and who can blame her! Tee! Hee! Hee! If you\u2019re looking for fabulous fabric or other patchwork patterns and supplies, pop into Pauline\u2019s on-line shop at www.quiltersworld.com.au but if you\u2019re on a budget, you\u2019d better hide your credit card first or you\u2019ll be tempted by all the wonderful things for sale!!\nTo the new project mentioned above ... another Card Kit is finished and available on the web site! This latest project is a small wall hanging with a stitchery panel that reads, \u201cLove Bears All\u201d and features one of the wonderful timber button versions of my signature bear, created by Lisa at Button Bliss, that I told you about in last \u201cHello From The Hug\u201d. And boy is it cute!! \u2013 if I do say so myself! The saying comes from one of my favourite Bible passages, 1 Corinthians 13 \u2013 the love chapter and I finished the wall hanging off with borders in a gorgeous, deep purple fabric that matches the flowers on the vine of the stitchery. As this is a Card Kit, it comes with a pretty, blank gift card featuring a photo of the finished wall hanging, an envelope, a piece of homespun, a paper version of the pattern to trace and full instructions on how to make it up into the wall hanging. Another great gift idea to give a friend, or spoil yourself if you\u2019re looking for small, easily achieved projects. From start to finish, you could complete this wall hanging in a day, so a great one to add to your list. Be sure to check it out on the \u201cWhat\u2019s New\u201d page. And there are a couple more Card Kits on the drawing board, so stay tuned!!\nYou\u2019ve all read about Fresh Hope Patterns through the newsletters so will know that I\u2019ve become more involved with that, but I\u2019ve also been slaving away at the drawing board to come up with a new pattern design for the Fresh Hope Patterns range. The first of three samples is finished, with two in various stages of completion! The basis of this pattern is a stitchery featuring a stylised version of the Fresh Hope Patterns dove logo and the wording says: \u201cLove lifts us high on wings of Hope!\u201d The pattern will include instructions to make the stitchery up as a cushion, a wall hanging and a framed piece. The cushion has been completed and is VERY eye-catching!! All of you who know me will know that I am usually the \u201cAnti-Pink\u201d, but in making up this cushion, I highlighted the fuchsia colour used for the Fresh Hope Patterns logo so this is not a cushion that can be easily ignored! Tee! Hee! Hee! My good friend Mary who runs FH Patterns is busily stitching the other two versions ready to make up into the wall hanging and framed piece, so once they\u2019re done, I\u2019ll let you know! In the meantime, why not check out the range available at Fresh Hope Patterns which includes quilts, dolls, bears, bags and more. Not only do you get a high quality craft pattern, you know you\u2019re helping support the Fresh Hope drug and alcohol rehabilitation program. For more information, visit www.freshhopepatterns.com.au\nFor those of you who\u2019ve been getting the newsletter and visiting the web site for a little while now, you will know that a third country cloth doll to complete the Tea Party Pals trio has been on the agenda for quite a while. Well ... you will be very pleased to know \u2013 she\u2019s finished!!! I had a very productive weekend recently and completed the prototype of the newest dolly \u2013 Berry Basket Bonnie! I fell in love with her outfit fabrics and that was all the inspiration I needed to finally bring her to life. She is a cute, petite dolly who is wearing a long sleeved dress with a pinafore that laces up the bodice and has a shaped skirt front. Bonnie is holding a cane basket of strawberries made from fabric and felt as well as a plump, ripe strawberry in her hand. A white strawberry flower decorates her hair and she has a stitched swing tag over her arm that reads, \u2018strawberry\u2019. She looks fabulous by herself, but looks even better side by side with her two Tea Party Pals \u2013 Cupcake Katie and Tea Cup Tilly. I\u2019ve added a photo of the trio to my blog which shows them ready for a tea party with some of the pretty china I collect and some of the faux cupcakes from Kerryanne English at Woodberry Designs which are mentioned in the instructions for Katie. Kerryanne has a FABULOUS range of faux cakes and goodies that add to country and shabby chic d\u00e9cor \u2013 and they aren\u2019t fattening! Tee! Hee! Hee! Check them out at the Shabby Art Boutique via Kerryanne\u2019s Woodberry Designs website: www.woodberrydesigns.com And keep an eye out for Berry Basket Bonnie on the web site \u2013 I just have to write up the instructions. (groan!!) Or take a peek at the photos of her on my blog \u2013 there is now a shortcut button to my blog from the front page of the Tag Along Teddies web site!\nI\u2019m still having a lovely time \u2018blogging\u2019 so if you\u2019ve got some spare time, make yourself a cuppa and have a little read to find out what I\u2019ve been up to and see photos of projects I\u2019ve been working on. A few people have had problems leaving comments on the blog, but you can always email me from the web site to let me know what you thought. And as always, I love to hear from other crafters, so if you\u2019ve got questions, comments or suggestions, drop me an email.\nTil next \u201cHello From The Hug\u201d,\nAre you like me and lucky enough to have a sewing room, or at least a study that you share as your sewing room? Why not set up an \u201cInspirations Board\u201d. Each time you complete a craft project, big or small, keeping or giving away, take a photo (and print it off your computer, don\u2019t just store it!!) and pin these photos all over the board. Intersperse these with clippings from magazines, or catalogues, of patterns and projects that you hope to tackle. If you design your own projects, include your rough/unfinished sketches so you can step back from them to fine tune. To make it pretty and to add to the inspiration, pin up special buttons, ribbons, braids and rick-rack that you collect along the way. Sometimes seeing things from a new angle will help you work out how you want to proceed, but more importantly, seeing what you\u2019ve achieved alongside what you want to achieve will inspire you to keep stitching!", "label": 1}
{"text": "Tribune-Courier News Reporter\nIn Marshall County Fiscal Court this month, Tim Polley, pastor of the First Christian Church Disciples of Christ, made a motion to honor emergency responders in Marshall County.\n\u201cThe first responders of Marshall County sacrifice their time and personal safety in the execution of their duties to protect the public on a daily basis,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd whereas first responders are the first line of defense for the public in the wake of threats to our homes and our families.\u201d\nThe court agreed to the motion, creating a weekend dedicated to those who work tirelessly in the wake of disasters in the region.\nFollowing Emergency Responders Weekend, earlier last week, Melissa (Combs) McFerrin, director of Marshall County Emergency Management was appointed as the state\u2019s Emergency Management Director of the Year.\nCombs started her career in emergency response as a volunteer firefighter with the East Marshall Fire Department in 1995, and said the work she did as a volunteer led her to where she is now.\nCombs was appointed director of Marshall County Emergency Management in May 2008 after working as the administrative specialist in the Marshall County office for four years. Combs said she was pleasantly surprised when she found out she had been selected as EM director of the year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a real honor to know, to suspect, that the nomination for director of the year came from region 2 and that they recognized our hard work,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot of work throughout the state with little resources so it\u2019s an honor.\u201d\nMarshall County is part of region 1 alongside 10 other counties. Combs said she, and her office, is tasked with coordinating local efforts in the event of an emergency.\n\u201cIf locals can\u2019t find the resources they need we are the liaison to other departments and to the state level,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are the networking between emergency services. We maintain good and open communication between channels.\u201d\nCombs helps coordinate several emergency service offices in Marshall County, including 10 fire departments, the sheriff\u2019s office, two police stations, the ambulance service, the rescue squad, the Lakeland chapter of the American Red Cross and the health department.\nShe said her work isn\u2019t stressful on a normal day, but when disaster strikes that can change quickly.\n\u201cWe get involved more with disasters \u2013 structure fires, floods, ice storms,\u201d she said. \u201cIf an agency needs help from other services that\u2019s where we step in,\u201d\n\u201cIt depends on the incident and what those responders need,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen there was a diesel leak weeks ago we made notifications to the state department and the EPA to let them know we were handling the hazard correctly.\u201d\nCombs said one of her projects that has been the most rewarding was helping establish the West Kentucky Incident Management Team which is comprised of emergency management agencies in the region.\nThe group meets monthly for fellowship and training to better learn what each can provide in the event of a disaster.\n\u201cWhen eastern Kentucky was hit with a tornado we deployed over there to help with emergency service coordination efforts,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve formalized a group of which I\u2019m proud to be a member.\u201d\nCombs said it\u2019s a continued effort in making sure her office promotes unity throughout the branches of service in the region \u2013 a very large task, she said.\n\u201cWe also help mentor other regions so they aren\u2019t left to fend for themselves and will be able to coordinate emergency response,\u201d she said.\nAnother project she and her office helped establish was a preplanning effort for Tater Day festivities.\nShe said the group plans ahead for a variety of hazards including weather.\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a successful effort and we\u2019ve been asked to keep that going,\u201d she said. \u201cIt brings together emergency responders and Kiwanis to help pre-plan for our events.\u201d\nThe emergency responders plan for the events throughout the weekend and Kiwanis coordinates the parade and the barbecue cook-off.\n\u201cThe meetings bring together the fire department, police department, ambulance service and the national weather service,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s been very helpful to bring everyone together to make these events run better.\u201d\nThe culmination of efforts by Combs led to her appointment as EM director of the year earlier in September.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Hey everybody,\nSorry I haven\u2019t posted in a while, I\u2019ve just gotten my computer back! It turns out that the hard drive was dead (so much for the whole indestructible Mac theory\u2026). Anyway, I\u2019m now going to attempt to condense the two and a half weeks since my last entry into an entry of reasonable length. This is sure to be a difficult task, and I will undoubtably leave some things out, but I will give it my best attempt.\nRemember those blunders I told you would inevitably occur? They arrived in full force a few days after I arrived. But before I share the tale, some exposition is necessary. I don\u2019t actually live in Copenhagen here in Denmark. I live in a small suburban city called Sovegetslev outside of another largish city called Roskilde to the west of Copenhagen. Normally I bike for twenty-five minutes to get to Roskilde and then take a regional train in to Copenhagen, and I take the same route back. Sounds simple enough right? Well apparently not. As I was trying to get home, I went to the station in Copenhagen only to find that I didn\u2019t see a train leaving to Roskilde like I did on the previous day when my host mom showed me how to get to the city and back. So I called her and she told me that normally the Nykobing Falster train stops in Roskilde so I should just hop on that one. Well, I did hop on that one and in my brand-new-to-Denmark ignorance I didn\u2019t check the list of stops. As you might expect, this train didn\u2019t stop in Roskilde, nor did it stop at the next station, or the next station, or the one after that. As a matter of fact when my saint of a host dad picked me up from middle-of-nowhere Denmark it took us an hour and a GPS to get back to the house. I had ridden the train to the other end of Denmark\u2019s most eastern island. Needless to say, I was rather embarrassed. But the silver lining was that I got to spend some quality time with my host dad and got to know him a lot better on the trip.\nThe random adventures continued when one day I was walking down the main shopping street of Copenhagen called St\u00f8get (don\u2019t even ask me how to pronounce it). I saw a large crowd of people gathering so naturally I stopped to see what was capturing the attention of so many. When I got closer I saw that a section of street was roped off and that there were twenty ceramic tigers sitting in a straight line in the middle of the street. I didn\u2019t find this all that interesting and I was just about to continue walking when suddenly, walking in a perfectly straight line out from the side of the street, came twenty people. Normally, twenty people walking in a line wouldn\u2019t attract much attention at all in a city like Copenhagen, but these twenty were quite unique in such a way that demanded attention. They were completely, totally, unavoidably, shockingly, naked. Then each of the twenty very naked people took their place behind each of the twenty tigers that no one was looking at anymore. Seemingly on cue, they raised the tigers over their heads, held the position for several seconds, and in unison smashed them into oblivion on the ground. This action was met with exuberant applause from the onlookers. By this point, I am utterly baffled. Is this a demonstration of some sort? Are the Danes, a people internationally known for their happiness with their lives and their approval of their government, actually protesting something? Seeking answers to the myriad questions running through my head, I begin to search the crowd for someone who looks like they understand what just happened. As I scan the masses I notice that several people dispersed throughout are wearing matching lanyards so I decided to approach one of them. After a quick conversation where we both spent a great deal of time laughing, the young woman informed me that I had just witnessed the opening of the Copenhagen modern art festival. I am continually amazed by the sorts of things that fall under the umbrella of art. In the end the opening served its purpose; I had no choice but to check out the art festival after witnessing the bomb-shell of its opening. I am very pleased to say that I ended up buying a great piece of artwork at the festival.\nAs part of our orientation, we were put into large groups which were then broken into smaller groups and sent running around the city to find different common tourist attractions and come back and report to the larger group on what we had found. It was a very informative day because it wasn\u2019t simply a scavenger hunt where you just found the building and went on your way. At each location they had a DIS professor sharing information about the place we had found. I\u2019ve included a video of the professor at the Royal Palace because he was very interesting to listen to and he shared some great insight into why the Danes love their constitutional monarchy so much (it was too long to upload here so I\u2019ve put in the link). http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y89qfW7b5H4&feature=youtu.be\nOnce the orientation for DIS was over, classes started in full force. So far I\u2019ve had human health and disease, medical ethics, Danish language and culture, the neuroscience of fear, and Russia past and present. I haven\u2019t had my impressionism in Paris or my Vienna capital of classical music classes yet, but they will start soon. My favorite class so far is definitely my human health and disease course. It\u2019s basically a miniature medical school class. So far we\u2019ve covered the GI system, the liver, pancreas and gall bladder. I already knew that I wanted to be a doctor but this class has been a major affirmation. I just can\u2019t imagine doing anything else with my life.\nI just went on the short study tour included in my program this past week. We visited Svendborg and Ribe, two cities in the main body of Denmark that lies to the west of the island that Copenhagen is on. It was very interesting to examine the Danish healthcare system and see just how different it is from our own. The Danes absolutely love their system and it works very well for them. The way the study tours are structured also allows for a good bit of sight-seeing as well. You\u2019ll see in my pictures where we visited a castle with a beautiful garden in Svendborg, and a cathedral in Ribe. The cathedral was particularly interesting because it has examples of each type of architecture that it has lived through, and there is modern art painted on the walls because it was agreed upon that each era has left it\u2019s mark on the cathedral so the modern era should be included too.\nI can honestly say that I\u2019m falling in love with this place now. It really hit me one night when I was walking home from a cafe visit with my Danish class. The sun was setting over the region of the city referred to as \u201cThe Lakes\u201d and the scene before me was so beautiful I was forced to stop, pull out my camera, snap some pictures, and soak it in for a while. The first picture in the gallery is the best one from that particular night.\nWell I haven\u2019t mentioned everything but this entry is starting to get prohibitively long so I\u2019m going to end it now. I promise that future entries will be closer together and shorter now that I have my computer back! Stay tuned.", "label": 1}
{"text": "I've been playing around and learning about WPF (Avalon) resources and ResourceDictionaries recently. I had a few questions pop up that the knowledgeable people on the Avalon team graciously answered for me. (Thanks to Rob Relyea, WeiBing Zhan, and Ashish Shetty)\nHere's a recap:\n1) I used to look at resources in reflector or ildasm, how can I see inside WPF resources?\nAs it turns out, reflector is still the tool du jour!\nFigure 1: Reflector's view of WPF Resources\n2) What's the difference between:\n<ResourceDictionary Source=\"ResourceDictionary.xaml\"/>\n<ResourceDictionary> <ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries> <ResourceDictionary Source=\"ResourceDictionary.xaml\"/> </ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries></ResourceDictionary>\nThe answer to this may seem obvious however the examples I had seen up to that point and the fact that I only had Chris Sells book to go on (which doesn't cover MergedDictionaries) left me wondering.\nIn both cases you end up with the same resources, the reason for the ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries property is to allow for this:\n<ResourceDictionary> <SolidColorBrush x:Key=\"myRed\" Color=\"Red\" Opacity=\"0.5\"/> <ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries> <ResourceDictionary Source=\"ResourceDictionary.xaml\"/> </ResourceDictionary.MergedDictionaries></ResourceDictionary>\nSince the following is not valid:\n<Window.Resources> <ResourceDictionary Source=\"ResourceDictionary.xaml\"/> <SolidColorBrush \u2026 /> <!\u2014this solid color brush is not allowed</Window.Resources>\n3) What is the difference between setting the build action on a XAML file that only contains a ResourceDictionary to page and to resource?\nIn other words, suppose you have a XAML file that contains only a ResourceDictionary \u2013 should you use the \u201cPage\u201d, \u201cResource\u201d or \u201cEmbedded Resource\u201d build action?\nYou don\u2019t want to use \u201cEmbedded Resource\u201d \u2013 that simply doesn\u2019t work. Specifying \u201cEmbedded Resource\u201d puts the resource in the .mresource section of the assembly, these resources need to go in the g.resources section (which in turn is in the .mresource section).\nMost likely you\u2019ll want to use the \u201cPage\u201d setting as it creates a .baml file, which adds compile time checking and improved runtime performance.\nYou can use Reflector to inspect the generated resources:\nFigure 2: Build action \"Page\" generates a more performant BAML file.\nFigure 3: Build action \"Resource\" generates an embedded XAML file.\nFollowing up on my previous article on Cider Item Creation, I want to talk a bit about Adorners. Brian Pepin introduces adorners in his article on User Interaction in Cider:For example, looking at the following screen shot:\nThe grid lines, the anchor lines, the grid information, the grab handles... all are done with adorners.\nOne of the cool things is that Cider uses the same infrastructure that we expose as extensibility points for control developers. This allows us to work with and get validation of the extensibility points we ship to customers.\nSo what does the code look like to write one of these things?\nI'll go over the high level details around writing a control that has 2 adorners. Note that if you want to try this at home, you'll have to wait for the next CTP. I'll be blogging about getting this sample working with the CTP when it becomes available.\nIn the screen shot below, the Slider is an adorner on the button as is the little square in the upper right hand corner. The slider adjusts the yellow gradient stop to be the position where the slider is and the little square pops a dialog when clicked.\n1) The first step is to decorate your Control such that it knows that there is an attached adorner.\n[Extension(typeof(SliderAdornerProvider))]public class SliderAdornedButton : Button{}\nThe Extension attribute is used to attach the SliderAdorner to the SliderAdornedButton class.\n2) Write the SliderAdornerProvider\nThe SliderAdornerProvider is an Extension. So what's an Extension? Well, essentially, when Cider loads up, it has an ExtensionManager which loads all of the Extensions found in metadata. This is an extensibility point for adding new functionality into Cider. They are lightweight features or add ins which don't require much from Cider and are created and destroyed within a given context\nEach group of Extensions have an ExtensionServer which manages its Extensions and can request and publish services, listen to events etc. ExtensionServers exist for the lifetime of Cider and are also a Cider extensibility point.\nIn this example, because the SliderAdornerProvider derives from PrimarySelectionAdornerProvider which has an associated ExtensionServer (AdornerProviderExtensionServer), we don't need to write one.\nclass SliderAdornerProvider : PrimarySelectionAdornerProvider { . . . }\nPrimarySelectionAdornerProvider is a Cider provided class that activates the adorner when the control that the adorner is attached to is the primary selection on the design surface.\nThe bulk of the work is in the constructor which creates two adorners and puts them in the adorner layer. The first is a Rectangle, the second is a Slider. The first step is to create the AdornerPanel:\npublic SliderAdornerProvider() { // All adorners are placed in an AdornerPanel // for sizing and layout support. AdornerPanel myPanel = new AdornerPanel();\nA Rectangle is instantiated, its position is set and its added to the AdornerPanel.\n// 10 pixels Rectangle adorner Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(); rect.Fill = Brushes.Azure; rect.Stroke = Brushes.Blue; rect.Width = rect.Height = 10.0; // Inset the slider 5 pixels from the top edge of the // control. AdornerPanel.SetAdornerOriginOffset(rect, new Vector(5, 5)); myPanel.Children.Add(rect);\nWe now add a Task that is fired when the Rectangle adorner is clicked:\n// Add a task to the Rectangle adorner that is // fired when we click on it. ToolCommand command = new ToolCommand(\"OpenPopup\"); Task task = new Task(); task.InputBindings.Add(new InputBinding(command, new ToolGesture(ToolAction.Click, MouseButton.Left))); task.ToolCommandBindings.Add(new ToolCommandBinding(command, OnOpenPopup)); AdornerPanel.SetTask(rect, task);\nEssentially, the OnOpenPopup method will be called when the Rectangle adorner is left clicked.\nNext up is the Slider Adorner:\n// adding a slider Slider slider = new Slider(); slider.Minimum = 0; slider.Maximum = 1; AdornerPanel.SetHorizontalStretch(slider, AdornerStretch.Stretch); AdornerPanel.SetVerticalStretch(slider, AdornerStretch.None); AdornerPanel.SetTargetSizeFactor(slider, new Vector(1.0, 0)); AdornerPanel.SetAdornerSizeFactor(slider, new Vector(0, 1.0)); AdornerPanel.SetAdornerOriginFactor(slider, new Vector(0, -1.0)); AdornerPanel.SetAdornerOriginOffset(slider, new Vector(0, -3)); myPanel.Children.Add(slider);\nHere you'll notice 6 calls to AdornerPanel methods that are setting up the resizing and repositioning behavior of the adorner relative to the control it adorns. We're still working on these APIs, however the key things to notice are that the Slider adorner will stretch horizontally to always be the same size as the control it adorns, it will not stretch vertically and its positioned above the control it adorns.\nNow when the slider values change, I also want to update the control that is being adorned:\n// handle the slide slider.ValueChanged += new RoutedPropertyChangedEventHandler<double>(slider_ValueChanged);\nFinally, add it to the Adorner layer:\n// Finally, add our panel to the Adorners collection Adorners.Add(myPanel); }\nThe event handlers for the adorner events are pretty straight forward (yes, yes it creates a new LinearGradientBrush every time, that can and should be optimized out) :\nvoid slider_ValueChanged(object sender, RoutedPropertyChangedEventArgs<double> e) { UIElement adornedControl = AdornerPanel.GetAdornedElement((UIElement)sender); SliderAdornedButton button = adornedControl as SliderAdornedButton; if (button != null) { LinearGradientBrush gradBrush = new LinearGradientBrush(); gradBrush.StartPoint = new Point(0, 0); gradBrush.EndPoint = new Point(1, 1); gradBrush.GradientStops.Add(new GradientStop(Colors.Red, 0.0)); gradBrush.GradientStops.Add(new GradientStop(Colors.Yellow, e.NewValue)); gradBrush.GradientStops.Add(new GradientStop(Colors.Green, 1));\nbutton.Background = gradBrush; } }\nprivate void OnOpenPopup(object sender, ExecutedToolEventArgs args) { MessageBox.Show(\"Hello Cider\"); }\nThat's it! Your first adorner.\nOne of the things this sample highlights is that adorners can be any class that derives from UIElement. There is no adorner base class. It also shows the reuse opportunities for adorners as well as the flexibility they provide in terms of providing a customized design time experience for your control\nObviously there are a lot of details and functionality that was glossed over, I'll be drilling down into various parts of our extensibility mechanisms in the coming weeks. Stay tuned.\nIn Windows Forms, there were many occasions when you wanted to separate out your design time code from your runtime code. For design time code you didn't want to execute at runtime, you would use a designer and for runtime code you didn't want to execute at design time (i.e. it did a bunch of database access) in most situations you could use the Control.DesignMode property.\nThe problem with Control.DesignMode was that it depended on IComponent.Site being set for your control. Unfortunately, there were cases when this wasn't true, most noteably in the constructor of that control.\nIf you've seen Brian Pepin's articles on the Cider designer (part 1 here and part 2 here) you'll know that in Cider, we've gone away from IComponent. This means that there isn't a Control.DesignMode property for WPF/Avalon controls.\nInstead, Cider's Extension architecture (again see Brian's articles) is used to add a CustomInstanceFactory to a control. When Cider goes to instantiate that control, instead of calling \"new\" or \"Activator.CreateInstance\" it calls its CustomInstanceFactory instead.\nFor example:\npublic bool SetIsDesignMode { get { return this.IsDesignMode; } set { this.IsDesignMode = value; } }}\nclass SliderAdornerInstanceFactory : CustomInstanceFactory{\npublic override object CreateInstance(Type type, params object[] arguments) { object instance = base.CreateInstance(type, arguments); SliderAdornedButton sab = instance as SliderAdornedButton;\nif (sab != null) sab.SetIsDesignMode = true; return instance; }}\nIn other words, at design time, if there is a Custom Instance Factory attached to an object, it is used to instantiate the object instead of the designer itself. This extensibility point allows you to set a bool indicating that you are in design mode (as the sample code above shows) and do any other design time specific code.\nIn fact, you could even return a design time specific instance of your control. As an example, Cider currently uses this mechanism to provide our own design time version of Window since we can't use a real Window instance as it cannot be parented to another control.\nTo summarize: Custom Instance Factories provide the ability to hook into the creation of your control at design time.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Pinterest is quietly earning affiliate commission off of some images that its users \u201cpin\u201d on the site and, while some users are getting vocal about the practice, the company whose technology makes it possible says it\u2019s not a big deal.\nThat company is Skimlinks, and in a blog post today, co-founder Alicia Navarro calls what Pinterest is doing \u201ca very popular, mainstream, and valuable approach to content monetization.\u201d\nOnline communities need ways to generate revenue to support their operations, and the preference is always to earn this revenue without disrupting their users or detracting from their UI with flashy advertisements. Creating a beautiful, user-friendly site, as Pinterest has done, mandates a non-intrusive way to make money.\nThat non-intrusive way basically works like this: If a user submits content to Pinterest that links back to a website with an affiliate program, Pinterest (via Skimlinks\u2019 technology) will change the link so that it includes Pinterest\u2019s affiliate code. Pinterest then makes money if other users click the link and make a purchase.\nJosh Davis wrote about this yesterday and the story picked up a lot of steam, with online coverage from the New York Times, CBS News and others. But the story has been percolating in the affiliate industry since last month \u2014 see articles by Scott Jangro and Joel Garcia, for example.\n\nNavarro addresses that issue in her Skimlinks post, saying that Pinterest isn\u2019t legally bound to disclose the affiliate links because it\u2019s not endorsing the products that its users post on the site.\nBy providing a platform where people can post things they like, Pinterest isn\u2019t endorsing particular products for the sake of financial gain, just providing a valuable forum for products to be browsed by their community. So it is understandable that they didn\u2019t want to make a big deal of this, especially as so many other content sites also use Skimlinks and affiliate marketing technology to help fund their operations.\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Pinterest for more information, as have others, but the company has not replied at this point. If they do, we\u2019ll update the post. But they\u2019ve been quiet since the issue came up weeks ago, and it seems unlikely \u2014 to me, at least \u2014 that they\u2019ll change that position soon.\nRelated Topics: Affiliate Marketing | Channel: Content Marketing | Pinterest | Pinterest: Business Issues | Social Media Marketing | Top News\nLike This Story?

In Pennsylvania, we have what\u2019s called \"First Party Benefits\" coverage. That means your car insurance \u2013 not the other driver\u2019s insurance \u2013 is responsible for your medical bills.\nThe amount of money you receive for your medical bills depends on the amount of coverage you chose for your car insurance policy. Once that money runs out, your own health insurance kicks in.\nThere are some cases where the other driver may be held responsible for costs related to your car accident, but medical bills are nearly always handled this way for car accidents in Pennsylvania.\nWhat if I Don\u2019t Have Car Insurance?\nIf you\u2019re underinsured \u2013 or even worse, uninsured \u2013 there will be serious limits to what type of money you\u2019ll receive for your medical bills.\nFor people injured in pedestrian accidents without any car insurance, there\u2019s the Pennsylvania Assigned Claims Plan. For example, if you\u2019re uninsured and were hit by a car as a pedestrian or injured in a bicycle accident, and you don\u2019t own a car, you may be able to receive limited coverage from this program.\nWhat Edgar Snyder & Associates Does for You\nWere you injured in a car accident?

ISSN 1517-8382.\nVarious carbon sources were evaluated for production of inulinase by yeast, Kluyveromyces marxianus MTCC 3995. Highest inulinase activity was observed with Dahlia extract (25.3 nkat mL-1) as carbon source. The enzyme activity was 1.4 folds higher than that observed in media containing pure chicory inulin (17.8 nkat mL-1). The yeast showed good growth on a simple medium containing dahlia extract (20% w/v) and yeast extract (2%w/v) as carbon and nitrogen source respectively, in 96 h. at 28\u00b0C and 120 rpm. Lowest inulinase yield (4.8 nkat mL-1) was seen in the medium containing glucose as C-source. Although varied inulinase levels were noticed on different C- sources, Inulinase: Sucrase (I/S) ratios were noticed to be similar. Among various protein sources tested, yeast extract was found to be the best source followed by beef extract (17.9 nkat mL-1) and peptone (13.8 nkat mL-1). The enzyme was optimally active at pH (4.0) and 50\u00b0C. TLC analysis of end product revealed that inulinase hydrolyzed inulin exclusively into fructose. Results suggest that the dahlia extract induced exoinulinase synthesis in Kluyveromyces marxianus and can be utilized as a potential substrate for inulinase production.\nPalabras llave : Inulinase; dahlia; fructose; Kluyveromyces marxianus.", "label": 1}

For many of us, the default position is to ignore it, assuming either that businesses wouldn't offer free stuff, or that there's a catch. However, in this marketing-saturated world organizations realize that offering free samples or information to potential customers can help to increase their business in the long run. Others have simply identified a rich vein of information to be mined and misused, or twisty tricks to lure consumers into paying for shoddy or non-existant goods.\nA lot of advertisers and manufacturers will give away free samples such as merchandise and portions of their products to entice you to explore their web-sites, and hook you into loyalty to buy from them in the future. Although very popular in the United States, you can find just as many internet websites that offer free stuff in the UK and other countries.\nOffers of free stuff range anywhere from watches, clothing, electronics, household commodities, computers, stereo systems and additional goods that we tend to use in many of our daily lives. Brand-name consumable products are frequently offered, and can be a convenient way of trying out a new product. But much of it is low-quality junk that will amount to more clutter in your life. E-books, newsletters, and downloadable programs and tools are popular as well, especially with blogs and sites that mostly sell information.\nWith common sense and a bit of research, you can find reputable sources of free or low-cost goods and services. Here are some specific areas of caution.\nOne quite popular way to implement this is by having visitors fill out surveys. These businesses find out what people think of their products and their views about them all. Most of these survey sites feature free awards and other merchandise and some individuals offer revenue for filling out their online surveys. Be VERY wary of surveys that ask you any information about yourself -- this personal information can be linked to your internet address and used for questionable purposes. Be wary of providing your telephone number or birth date unless there is a clear need for it, as well. Surveys are a prime way for \"crammers\" to obtain information to pack unwanted \"services\" onto your phone bill, which can be very hard to get rid of. Paid surveys rarely pay enough to be worth the time, but if you decide to try survey-taking as a routine way of getting merchandise or revenue, research and sign up for a an account through a reputable broker.\nThere are legitimate sweepstakes and games, especially when the sponsor is a major corporation offering its own products along with a grand prize of some kind. However, smaller organizations may be offering sweepstakes as either a way to get your information to sell for marketing purposes, or to induce you to view a high-pressure sales pitch. Most \"win a new car\" sweepstakes are prime examples of this category. Be wary of sweepstakes offering generic prizes such as cutlery, tennis bracelets, or vacations to specific locales.\nFree software\nFree software offered by reputable sites can be a wonderful bargain. Some is open-source software that performs functions similar to big-ticket brands, created and distributed by designers who believe that code should be freely shared. Companies will often give away free downloads of a single element of a suite of programs, knowing that many users will want to purchase the full product after trying the free one. Some also offer outdated versions for free or very reduced price for the same reason.\nHowever, free software is also one of the prime targets for deceptive and actively harmful practices. Be very careful of using any free download site that requires you to fill out a survey before gaining access to the content. Font and clipart sites are prime culprits, very frequently little more than sites designed to get your information, or get you to sit still while adware and spyware are transferred to your system. There are many good sites, but be sure your virus and spyware software is up to date if you plan to download from a site you're not familiar with. The best way to find reputable download sites is to start with well-regarded resource sites in that field. Also be wary of hidden subscription schemes, where accepting the \"free\" software obligates you to a monthly subscription that charges you for open-source software freely available on the Web. If you have to enter a credit card number to ship your free software, be cautious.\nYou will have to be careful of those sites which are offering free stuff to simply obtain your information. They then will sell your information to people you may not want to hear from, or who may target you not just for sales, but for scams. Be sure that whatever website you choose to do business with is legitimate and that they are not just fraudulent to get you to visit to their website and mine data about you.\nPractice good Internet hygeine. To keep your private info private and your inbox spam-free, consider using a disposable free email address for responding to offers, filling out surveys, etc. If you have a PayPal account, be cautious about using your PayPal email to sign up on sites you're unfamiliar with. Read the Terms of Use and Terms of Service carefully before signing up: federal law requires sites to disclose conditions such as subscriptions, but they are often cleverly hidden in the TOU/TOS. Don't fill out an information field just because it's asked for, if there doesn't seem to be any need for the information. Ask yourself, \"What is the purpose here?\"\nDo your homework. Before signing up for a membership to get free stuff, use your search engine to search \"nameofsite.com + complaints\" or \"nameofsite.com + reviews\" to see what experiences others have. For sofware, check sites like PC Magazine for reviews. There are sites that review and rate survey sites, also.\nNo phishing. Never click directly on a link in an unsolicited email, or copy and paste the address: if you're interested in the offer, type the URL directly into the address bar. If it purports to come from a familiar company, go to the company's site directly, then search for the offer. Check ftc.gov for additional tips on phishing safety.\nKnow before you go. Understand the terms related to website data protection. \"Certified\" websites just means that the data you enter is encrypted and is unlikely to be mined by a third party while being transmitted -- it does not mean that the website is a reputable business. \"Secured\" - the URL starts with \"https:\" rather than \"http:\" has a similar meaning.", "label": 1}

Sit down,\" replies a man in the room tersely.\nThe scene, which comes 45 minutes into the 1983 film The Right Stuff, shifts the focus from air to space in the movie adaptation of Tom Wolfe's nonfiction novel about the United States' first astronauts.\nA toy cowboy dolls watches a cliffhanger episode of the 1950s TV show that inspired his existence and has now made him a collector's item.\n\"Hey, w-wait, What happened? What happens next? Come on, let's see the next episode!\", begs the cowboy.\n|Woody shares the cover with Sputnik (Image: Disney/Pixar)\n\"That's it,\" replies a toy prospector doll, another character from the same show.\n\"What?\" asks the cowboy incredulously.\n\"The show was cancelled after that,\" says the prospector.\n\"Wait, wait, wait. What about the gold mine and... and the cute little critters and the dynamite?\" the cowboy queries. \"That was a great show! I mean, why cancel it?\"\n\"Two words,\" explains the prospector. \"Sput-nik. Once the astronauts went up, children only wanted to play with space toys.\"\nThe scene, from the 1999 Disney/Pixar animated sequel, Toy Story 2 changes the world view of the toy cowboy.\nThe real Sputnik changed the real world, dividing the past from the future.\nAs former NASA historian Roger Launius once noted, \"almost immediately, two phrases entered the American lexicon to define time, 'pre-Sputnik' and 'post-Sputnik'.\"\nIt's therefore no surprise that Hollywood filmmakers would use Sputnik as a plot device.\nIt was a movie released nine months before Toy Story 2 however, that gave Sputnik its first major role, beginning with its title.\nUniversal Pictures' October Sky was based on the true story of Homer Hickam, Jr., a NASA engineer who as a teenager was inspired to pursue a career in spaceflight after watching Sputnik cross the evening October sky in Coalwood, West Virginia. Hickam and a few friends, the \"Rocket Boys\", designed their own model rockets, which led them to entering and winning a science competition.\n|Sputnik crosses the October Sky (Image: Universal Pictures)\nAs the film opens, the citizens of Coalwood are reacting to the news of Sputnik's launch. To most of them, its a curiosity and a brief distraction from the day-to-day life in the coal mine.\n\"We're told that Sputnik will be visible to the naked eye about an hour after sunset and an hour before dawn as it traverses the October sky...\" informs a radio broadcast.\n|Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam (Image: Universal Pictures)\nStill, as Sputnik is scheduled to fly overhead the following evening, the town comes outside to see it. Hickam joins the crowd as someone spots the satellite, soon becoming entranced by the sight and setting his future in motion.\n\"I'm going to build a rocket... like Sputnik,\" Hickam tells his stunned-into-silence family at the breakfast table the next morning. \"Well, I'm not saying it's going to go up in space or anything, but I'm going to do it. I'm going to build a rocket,\" he says with a wide smile.\n\"Well, just don't blow yourself up,\" replies his mother.\nWhile a personal story, October Sky captured in Hickam and Coalwood an experience shared across the U.S. and the world.\nThe public's reaction to Sputnik is the focus of a new film by director David Hoffman. Sputnik Mania (formerly: The Fever of '57) tells the whole story of the launch of Sputnik and what happened to America during the following year. The feature-length documentary has been completed just in time to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Sputnik's launch.\n|Sputnik hits the headlines (Image: Universal Pictures)\nLearn more:\nCountdown: 10 \u2022 9 \u2022 8 \u2022 7 \u2022 6 \u2022 5 \u2022 4 \u2022 3 \u2022 2 \u2022 1\n\u00a9 1999-2013 collectSPACE.com All rights reserved.\nQuestions?

I still like wood and we carry wood floorings but it does suffer damage and you have maintenance costs that you don't with vinyl and it gives you the same look and feel with better autistics and warmth. Today many of the simulated products are better than the real thing.

(\"If the palms fly away, the parrots will too!\"), a national campaign was launched in Ecuador on 30 March for the conservation of the Wax Palm, the Yellow-eared Parrot and the Golden-plumed Parakeet. The campaign is being organised by Aves&Conservaci\u00f3n (BirdLife in Ecuador) and the Jocotoco Foundation, and has received official support from the Ecuador Ministry of Environment.\nThe Yellow-eared Parrot Ognorhynchus icterotis was once a common parrot in the northern Andes provinces of Ecuador, where Aves&Conservaci\u00f3n is focusing its conservation efforts; while the Golden-plumed Parakeet Leptosittaca branickii was formerly common across the whole country but is now confined to the southern Andes provinces, where the Jocotoco Foundation is leading the work.\n\u00a1Si vuelan las Palmas, palman los loros!\n(\"If the palms fly away, the parrots will too!\")\nThe main threat for these two parrot species is the disappearance of the wax palm which is being exploited in an unsustainable fashion each year for the celebration of Palm Sunday. Thousands of wax palms are \"harvested\" every year to fulfill the demand for palms at this Easter Catholic celebration (the great majority of Ecuadorians are Catholics and very attached to such traditions). The extraction of the central leaves of the palm prevents its development and often causes the death of the specimen. Wax palms need around 2530 years to reach their reproductive stage and more than 75100 years to die off naturally and become suitable places in which the parrots can rest and build nests.\nAves&Conservaci\u00f3n has established links with the Catholic Church in Ecuador and is lobbying to receive its official endorsement to promote the use of alternatives, such us corn leaves and eucalyptus, instead of wax palm.\nMaterials produced by Aves&Conservaci\u00f3n and the Botanical Gardens of Quito (with the support of several other organisations), are being distributed before Easter at the Botanical Garden as well as outside Churches in the three main cities of the northern Andes Provinces (Imbabura, Pichincha and Tungurahua).", "label": 1}

{"text": "It is with deeply mixed feelings that I realised a few days ago there will be a new docking station for Boris bikes north of King\u2019s Cross. It will be on Crinan Street right next to King\u2019s Place, where the Guardian resides. It looks like it will be opened soon.\nOn the one hand side, it\u2019s really good to see the expansion of the cycle hire scheme in the King\u2019s Cross area. The network of docking stations is particularly patchy in this part of the city. Although I\u2019m only a very casual user of the scheme (I prefer to use my own bike) it\u2019s very convenient to have a docking station right next to my office on Crinan Street.\nOn the other hand, the new docking station really gives me shivers. If you want to use it, you have to ride your bike on one of the most notorious and cycling unfriendly areas of central London \u2013 the infamous King\u2019s Cross gyratory.\nIf you happen to be south of Euston Street, you are forced to cross the junction where Deep Lee, a 24 year old arts student, was crushed by a lorry when she cycled to college on 3 October 2011. Since 2006, three other cyclists were killed by lorries in the area. Pedestrian and cycling campaigners have been fighting for years for a more human friendly redesign of the area but Transport for London did not bother to take action. They were more concerned about smoothing the traffic flow than improving the safety of cyclists. In December, the Camden New Journal reported about a special town hall meeting in CamdenSome improvement works at the dreadful junction are about to begin, but James Thomas, an architect and cyclist working on York Way who had a close look at TfL\u2019s plan, says the changes fall short of any real improvement. James, who built the memorial bike for Deep Lee, concludes that the plans bring\nno improvements in safety for cyclists\nThe new docking station north on York Way will lure Boris bikers to an area that is loathed even by very experienced quote an infamous sentence by Boris Johnson, they will find is amazingly difficult \u201cto have their wits about them\u201d.\nThere are no bike facilities on York Way whatsoever and cycling there is absolutely counter intuitive. Between Euston Road and Wharfdale Road, the left lane is used as a bus stop. Northbound cyclists who keep left happen to be squeezed in the middle of the traffic: busses on their left, fast moving cars and lorries on their right.\nI cycled there quite often and came to the conclusion that the \u201csafest\u201d way to ride there is if you position yourself on the road like a cyclist in Europe would do: I keep on the outer right lane next to the curb.\nHowever, if you want to carry on north behind Wharfdale Road, you have to cross two lanes of car traffic because York Way ceases to be a one-way street there. To get to the docking station on Crinan Street, you have to cross York Way with its four lanes of fast moving, aggressive drivers. (The better way to get to the docking station is a right turn onto Wharfdale Road and then a left into Crinan Street, but tourists and people not familiar with the area won\u2019t know.)\nI consider myself an experienced cyclist who tends not be scared easily but I always feel extremely queasy when I cycle on York Way. I usually use Pancras Way as an alternative to York Way . However, this tiny street between King\u2019s Cross Station and St. Pancras Station currently quite often comes closer to a car park for cabs than a street. In peak hours, it is almost impossible to cycle there at all. On top of that, Goods Way north of St. Pancras currently is a one way street in eastern direction and you have to cycle illegally on the curb if you want to get to King\u2019s Place.\nLeaving the docking station on Crinan Street by bike is a similar nightmare since you can\u2019t use the York Way south of Wharfdale Road. Imagine you cycled to the docking station on Crinan Street and find out it is full. If you\u2019re not aware of Pancras Street, cycling back to the docking stations south of King\u2019s Cross resembles a very personal \u201cTour du Danger\u201d.\nAll in all, the docking station on Crinan Street makes the case for segregated cycle lanes in the area even more compelling. Anything else would just be irresponsible and a gamble with human life.\nI cycle up there half-a-dozen times a year to go to the NCVO offices nearby. It has always been bad to be on two wheels around Kings X but the last year or so it has got much, much worse. Not only do you have to have your wits about you, you must be prepared to be scared out of them by the sheer panic-fuelled aggression of the drivers there, many of whom, mostly through no fault of their own, have not a clue where to go or which lane to take.\nYou also need a photographic memory or a GPS to copy with the maze of one-way streets. A Boris bike docking station is, I fear, a very mixed blessing.\nDrop me a line before you\u2019ll go there next time and let\u2019s have a coffee. I work on Crinan Street.\n[...] Comments \u00ab Cycling at King\u2019s Cross \u2013 A new docking station for Boris bikes gives me shivers [...]\nOne detail which would make Euston Road-Pentonville Road safer would be to close off the left turn in to York Way to all traffic except buses turning in to use the bus stands (not all bus stops) on York Way. this would eliminate the dangerous cutting up moves by traffic turning left, and if thought through properly would simplify the traffic signals sequence, and the junction as the pedestrian sequence to cross York Way could run with all the traffic going straight through to Pentonville Road. The relatively small number of vehicles turning left would then have to go round via Grays Inn Road and the route from Grays Inn Road in to York Way could be have the \u2018squeeze\u2019 from 2 lanes into 1.5 lanes opened to be 2 lanes of consistent width with a cycle lane right through the junction. If the bus left turn can be eliminated as well so much the better \u2013 but it may be operationally better to provide for buses making this turn through an exclusive lane from the bus stops at the front of the station.\nNote that Kings Cross Boulevard is now open and you can cycle up this to Goodsway \u2013 and eventually out from the top of the site to connect with Maiden Lane by the canal. I know how bad York Way can be. I spotted a truck coming up to pass me too close and rather than let the wing mirror clip my head I whacked it clear by raising my arm \u2013 that was clearly far too close to pass, and words were exchanged.\nThe other detail long campaigned for will be to have a Northbound cycle lane on Midland Road, an a right turn for cycles from Judd Street\nDave, thanks for your commment.\nI think every single measure that slows down motorised traffic around King\u2019s X means progress, preventing a left turn in to York Way being one of the options. (A complete re-design of York Way with a segregated cycle lane in both directions would be the preferred option, as far as I\u2019m concerned\u2026)\nI\u2019m aware of King\u2019s Cross Boulevard and love it. However, unfortunately, you still have to get there (via congested Pancras Road). A northbound cycle lane on Midland Road would be terriffic. However, my dream would be to close Pancras Road either entirely or at least in one direction for motorised traffic and turn it into shared space or build a segregated cycle lane there.\nTfL really need to sort out London\u2019s roads and making them safer for everyone. Ideally they should be installing dedicated cycle paths.\n[...] Cycling at King\u2019s Cross \u2013 A new docking station for Boris bikes gives me shivers ( [...]", "label": 1}

Today, you can\u2019t even buy a new car for $8,000, and you certainly can\u2019t buy a new SUV for $8,000.\nOr, maybe you can!\nWith gas prices headed toward $5 a gallon and a barrel of oil up three and a half dollars in a single day (again!) as I write this, many people have discovered that they cannot unload their formerly beloved Sport Utility Vehicles at any price. Vehicles that once cost over 30K new off the lot now have trade-in values of pennies on the dollar. If you\u2019ve already tried to trade down to something more fuel efficient, and you still owe on your auto loan on the SUV, you know what I\u2019m talking about.\nIt\u2019s depressing.\nNot to worry. A nice SUV is good for lots of other things besides driving. You just have to use your imagination and go with the flow. Get your bike down from the garage rafters, buy a public transit pass, and consider the following ideas for that beautiful gas hog:\n1) Use it for a vacation home. Around here, a cabin on the lake rents for upwards of $600 a week. That\u2019s a mere fraction of even the highest SUV payment. Park your baby somewhere beautiful, plug in one of those mini-fridges, and watch the sunset for a truly creative and economic stay-cation. When your week at the lake is up, rent your SUV out to friends and family members and use the income to pay off that loan and get the hybrid your budget craves.\n2) Put your mother-in-law in it. Building codes often prohibit separate mother-in-law quarters on your residential property, but you can park your SUV anywhere you want in your own yard. Get one of those prefab, concrete porch stoops, push it up to the hatch back door, plant some flowers, and presto! Instant mother-in-law apartment!\n3) Turn it into performance art. Apply for a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. Fill your SUV with foam peanuts and set fire to it in front of Ford Motor Company in Detroit while pretty girls dressed in Japanese \u201cHello Kitty\u201d outfits dance around it and roast marshmallows. Use the NEA grant money to pay off the loan, and film the performance with your mini-cam to put up on www.YouTube.com for passive income. Retire early, drive a Tesla.\n4) Give it away at the office Secret Santa exchange this December. This only works if you don\u2019t actually commute to work in it. If your coworkers are on to you, you might have to make your spouse do it.\n5) Drive it to New Orleans, donate it as temporary housing. Take the tax write off for a charitable contribution, and if your loan company comes after you, call the local papers and make sure it looks like they don\u2019t care about hurricane victims, at all, not even a little bit.\nThese are just a few, simple ideas to get you started. I\u2019m sure that with a little effort you can think up lots more. Probably readers of this blog have some they will post for you free of charge. Make a game of it. Get your friends to help you brainstorm other creative ways to use their SUVs too.\nWhen you get to 100 creative ways to use your SUV, write and publish these ideas as a book: 100 Ways to Use Your Useless SUV. In fact, if you go to www.lifetips.com and join as an author, they will publish your book for you (as long as it is 100 tips on, you know, anything) and sell it in bookstores and at Amazon and cut you $2 per copy sold, which really isn\u2019t that bad for something your friends actually did most of the work on. Keep all the money for yourself.\nRetire early. Drive a TeslaLOL! This would be even funnier if I were not entertaining the possibility of living in my van, given the rumors of layoffs spreading around my workplace. Hm. Wonder if my son will let me live in his driveway\u2026. How about plug into his electricity and water?\nSeriously, one of my neighbors apparently is doing exactly that: someone is living in a fifth-wheel the size of a small house that\u2019s been parked in his front driveway for weeks.

Pay experts said the banks would find a way around the rules - or leave Europe.\nJon Terry, remuneration partner at PriceWaterhouseCoopers, said: \u201cCapping bonuses to the extent proposed is a major problem for European banks and will create a huge wave of unintended consequences. Salaries are almost certain to rise substantially, leaving banks with less flexibility to reduce or claw-back bonuses when needed.\u201d\nHe addedThe agreement formed part of the Capital Requirements directive, a large piece of regulation that also included rules to force banks to disclose their profits they make in each country across Europe. The move is seen as a direct effort by countries that want to boost their tax take from financial firms.\nIain Coke, head of the financial services at the ICAEW, told reporters: \u201cCountry-by-country reporting is not of use to investors and should not be included in annual reports.

{"text": "Much of tax law scholarship concerns how to improve tax compliance; in this literature, tax evasion is held out as normatively undesirable. A senior researcher at the London-based Royal Society of Arts recently published a paper in which he argues that tax evasion in the UK might (actually) be a good thing. In \u201cUntapped Enterprise,\u201d Benedict Dellot argues that the \u201cinformal economy\u201d \u2013 those workers who do not declare their income for tax purposes \u2013 are an important part of the formal economy and that \"formalization\" itself is a process that occurs over the lifecycle of a business. In some parts of the developing world, for example, the informal economy accounts for up to 90% of GDP. The authors argue \u201cIf we rely too heavily on deterrence measures, we run the risk of derailing this[formalization] journey and preventing the entrepreneurial potential of thousands of hidden entrepreneurs from being realised.\u201d\nThe study, of course, has some application limitations, but it\u2019s an interesting read. Should tax policy accommodate certain forms of \u201cproductive\u201d noncompliance? Does it already do so? I'd love to hear from some of our tax readers on this!\nWe academics should wake up and realize that we are merely some of the more highly paid elements among the army of working stiffs who can do little to avoid paying our fair share even if we have larceny in our hearts. That means that with reporting of our income by employers and withholding coupled with reporting of most of our other income (royalties, interest, dividends, etc.) we cannot avoid declaring virtually all of our income without incurring penalties. The IRS also has access to considerable electronic records on many of our deductions, assuming we itemize. We are in a class with other wage earners who for the most part, when it comes to income taxes, pay most of what we should.\nOwner operators of many businesses are in a very different category. They have the financial motivation to cheat and the capacity to suppress reported income with some considerable freedom to cover their tracks in doing so. Among these individuals, the income tax often acts as a tax on integrity. I intensely dislike hearing from any advocate who cheers on he efforts of such dishonest individuals. Making all pay their fair share as dictated by law is an ethical issue. Those scoundrels who cheat, cheat not only the government but the rest of us who willingly or unwillingly pay our fair share. Scholarship that champions such behavior comes from the ethically indifferent who most likely are desperate to obtain academic attention regardless of the ethical issues involved. I am not surprised to see such grandstanding for attention among entertainers and politicians. It is most unfortunate to witness it among individuals holding themselves out as academic scholars,\nPosted by: Bill Turnier | November 29, 2012 at 08:55 AM\nI think Bill's response is an appropriate one to the suggestion of Taja-Nia's headline. But the headline doesn't, I think, quite capture the argument of the policy brief. I read the brief to be arguing for something like \"responsive regulation\" -- the goal is not to ignore tax evasion, but instead to increase tax compliance through methods other than simply penalizing noncompliance. There are a few folks now who have suggested that rewarding and educating \"good\" tax actors and reserving enforcement efforts for the worst could be more effective than pure penalties.\nHaving said that, a differentiated regime has serious targeting problems. In the U.S., for instance, most studies conclude that primarily-cash businesses pay something like half the tax they owe, and that those businesses are in the vicinity of 20% of the economy. Maybe one can change that behavior through education and \"responsive\" tax administration. But if not, or if the penalties are waived for actors who turn out to be \"bad,\" reducing penalties is quite likely to drop the revenue collected even lower, and when you multiply that by 20% of the economy, you're talking a lot of money.\nPosted by: BDG | November 29, 2012 at 09:33 AM\nBDG: Agreed. The headline was written - in true NY fashion - to rope in readers. The study is about regulatory normativity, not (necessarily) behavioral normativity; regulatory regimes influence behavior, of course, but that's not the full picture here. Also, the targeting problem you describe is a serious one, esp. outside the US, where cash businesses account for an even greater share of the economy. I'm interested in your take on the \"lifecycle\" argument; is there something inherent in entrepreneurialism that warrants targeted tax treatment?\nPosted by: Taja-Nia Henderson | November 29, 2012 at 11:11 AM\nif i grow vegetables in my backyard and i share some of the harvest with friends, and if my friends share some of their stuff with me, we are engaging in an informal economy that any government would like to tax. but in order to tax this activity, the government first has to monetize what those of us engaging in this informal economy might not have chosen to monetize. the transition occurs when we get beyond friends or when we ourselves start monetizing our exchanges. my backyard farm cannot make the transition to a sustainable commercial operation without working through this \"formalization.\" this can occur organically, or i can be forced to seek capital investors or borrow money from a bank. if i go the organic route, at what point am i a \"scoundrel\" who \"cheats\" those who are engaged in a structured wage economy.\nPosted by: Zach Bender | November 29, 2012 at 05:32 PM", "label": 1}

I cannot possibly cram all of that knowledge in my head and be expected to perform well. I consider myself to have good time management skills, but sometimes it just isn\u2019t feasible, no matter how hard you try to complete all tasks.\nMost times, the material required for the exams has not been covered until a few days prior to the exam date. What about other aspects of students\u2019 lives? Where do hobbies, interests and other extracurricular activities fit in? I do not want school work to consume my life.\nWhat I don\u2019t understand is that professors and other influential people in our lives are encouraging us to be active, to get out there and to differentiate ourselves from the crowd, yet we are also constantly reminded that it is essential to excel at our school work. When is there time? When is there time to sleep, eat, work, complete course requirements and enjoy life?\nIt is a juggling act. You must attempt to prioritize your tasks and complete them in a timely manner. Of course, this may mean a few all nighters along the way and a few dollars spent on coffees and energy drinks but it is all worth it in the end. All of this hard work, motivation and dedication is ultimately a commitment, and sometimes a sacrifice, to guide you to where your future path may lead. It is an investment, so make your decisions wisely.\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, school work is definitely my number one priority these days, but I also need down time to relax. If I don\u2019t manage my time, I am going to crash and burn. I occasionally need to re-energize. The thing that is getting me through this next month or so is that once exams are over, we have three weeks of Christmas holidays to unwind before classes start again and we have to repeat the exhausting process once more.\nFor now, I will continue to slave away at my school work. I will more than likely set up camp in one of my favourite, cozy places in the library. In fact, I think it is about time I start paying rent to the library; it has literally become my new home. On the up side, the busier I am, the faster time goes and the faster I am finished my exams. Now if I can only focus on my studies long enough instead of thinking about the holidays, I would be ahead of the game. Good luck.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Tue 2 Aug 2011\nGen Ys @ Work say: Keep the Moola, Give me a Mentor!\nPosted by Alicia under C-Suite, Career Advice, Career Coaches, Career Development, Coaching, First Job, Gen Y, Job Interviewing Tips, Leadership, Management, Mentoring, Millennials, Training & Development, twentysomethings\n[2] Comments\nI want to first start out by thanking my colleague, Susan Whitcomb, a wonderful career coach and President of the Career Coach Academy for sending me this article in the Business Insider written by Vivian Giang titled: \u201dIf You Want to Retain The Best Young Workers, Give Them A Mentor Instead of Cash Bonuses\u201c. According to the article, in a recent annual Global CEO Survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, 20-somethings, also known as Gen Y/Millennials rated training and development way above cash bonuses as their first choice in benefits.\nThe research that I did this past year validated the results from the survey. As I interviewed 20-somethings that had been working from one to five years, over 80% had either left a job or were aggressively looking for one. Why? All of them were shocked by the reality they faced when they started working. None of them were prepared for it and all of them wished they had known ahead of time so that perhaps they would have asked better questions during the interview to determine if there was a good fit. But even if they still had to take a job regardless of fit, they all felt that knowing would have helped with a better transition.\nWhat was shock #1 for these Gen Yers? Having to report to bad bosses and/or not having mentors they could go to. In my new e-book, New @ Work: An Insider\u2019s Survival Guide to a Crazy Workplace, I give new hires some probing questions to ask during an interview so they can determine if their prospective employer embraces mentoring and whether or not their next boss has \u201chorrible boss\u201d characteristics.\nIn my experience having worked as a corporate executive for over 25 years, I find that new hires don\u2019t take enough advantage of the interview process. The interview provides a great opportunity to get to know important things about the organization and the person who will be your boss. Too often, young interviewees are so concerned about making a good impression that they either don\u2019t ask a lot of questions or ask very predictable ones.\nInterviewers have typically been through hundreds of interviews and usually have heard the same questions being asked over and over again. A way to stand out is to ask them questions that make them think, that get them out of their comfort zone. As long as you ask it in a non-threatening manner and from a place of curiosity, the interviewer will most likely remember you from the countless other interviews he or she has had. In today\u2019s world, young interviewees need to find creative ways to get on the employers radar preferably before the interview but certainly during the interview.\nAs I was reading the Insider Edition article, I was noticing some of the comments that were posted. Many of them appeared to be from Gen Yers who disagreed with the survey results and rated cash bonuses over mentoring. Although this is understandable in today\u2019s unstable economic times, I believe it ultimately backfires. It\u2019s a case of being penny wise and pound foolish.\nHaving had mentors and being a mentor during my long career, I can attest to the huge benefits mentors provide. They are able to fastrack your career. They show you where the landmines are located, what to do and not do and how best to stand out and get noticed. Mentors provide a shortcut to becoming successful at work. Although that may not be as appealing as a cash bonus in the short term, I can vouch that it has much better financial benefits in the long term.\nMentoring has allowed me to make strategic moves in my career that have ultimately gotten me higher increases, better bonuses and more importantly, positioned me to become a high performer which is the cream of the talent crop in an organization. Cash bonuses could not have done that and eventually, those bonuses would probably shrink without a \u201cSuccess GPS\u201d that only a mentor can provide.\nIn my e-book I give some advice on how to find mentors in or outside an organization if someone finds him or herself working for a bad boss or an organization that doesn\u2019t foster mentoring. Mentoring is that important to your career whether you are 20-something or 50-something.\nWhen you have a good mentor, the cash will come. Without one, it\u2019s a rocky road.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Skip to Main Content\nA facsimile data compression system, called combined symbol matching (CSM), is presented. The system operates in two modes: facsimile and symbol recognition. In the facsimile mode, a symbol blocking operator isolates document symbols such as alphanumeric characters and other recurring binary patterns. The first symbol encountered is placed in a library, and as each new symbol is detected, it is compared with each entry of the library. If the comparison is within a tolerance, the library identification code is transmitted along with the symbol location coordinates. Otherwise, the new symbol is placed in the library and its binary pattern is transmitted. Nonisolated symbols are left behind as a residue, and are coded by a two-dimensional run-length coding method. In the symbol recognition mode, the library is prerecorded and each entry is labeled with its ASCII code. As each character is recognized, only the ASCII code in transmitted. Computer simulation results are presented for the CCITT standard documents. With text-predominate documents, the compression ratio obtained with the CSM algorithm in the facsimile mode exceeds that obtained with the best run-length coding techniques by a factor of two or more and is comparable for graphics-predominate documents. In the symbol recognition mode, compression ratios of 250:1 have been achieved on business letter documents.\nPublished in:\nProceedings of the IEEE (Volume:68 , Issue: 7 )\nDate of Publication: July 1980", "label": 1}
{"text": "Many people have reported encounters with the shark over the past thirty years or so but the story began as a hoax by journalists and then quite unexpectedly grew to have a life of its own and became an urban legend. The tales told about the animal provide an example of an urban legend that can be traced to its origins. The affair is very similar to the Great Wall of China hoax.\nThe shark has been reported from many parts of False Bay but is said to spend most of its time around Seal Island. (This is not an unreasonable thing for an obligate marine carnivore to do, as the island teems with Cape fur seals).\nThe fish is said to be so large it shows up on sonar. Reports of its length vary but figures of six to eight metres are quoted.\nThe results stunned everyone involved. The switchboards were immediately jammed with reports of sightings of the shark, or of the exact details of its markings and habits, or of its exact length.\nThis old story may have also provided the idea for the hoax \"Helicopter Shark\" image, a composition of two photographs that appeared to show a huge great white attacking a person on a ladder hanging from a helicopter. The writeup typically said it was from \"near South Africa\", although the helicopter shot was clearly taken from San Francisco Bay in California. The helicopter in the picture is a HH-60 Pave Hawk, a model that is flown by the California Air National Guard. Closer inspection also reveals two swimmers in the water under the helicopter.\nIn some variants it was also alleged to be a National Geographic Society photo of the year, so the Society went to some lengths to uncover the source photos, and wrote about the hoax in a 2005 issue of the National Geographic Magazine.", "label": 1}
{"text": "\u201cBe the change you want to see in the world.\u201d \u2013 Mahatma Gandhi\nThat Gandhi quote pops up in a lot of places. It\u2019s often used as encouragement for people to give of themselves for a greater cause, with the justification being that societal changes and charities can\u2019t live up to their full potential if you\u2019re not willing to give of yourself to push that cause forward.\nHere\u2019s the kicker: that core idea is true in every aspect of your life.\nAll of us want something different in our lives, buth from ourselves and from the people around us. We want a better financial future. We want better health. We want more responsible behavior. We want relationships that fulfill us. We want time and passion to chase our interests.\nYet, anyone with much experience in adult life knows that you don\u2019t simply get everything that you want, from yourself or from others.\nThe world doesn\u2019t always work the way we want it to work, just because we want it to work that way.\nThe best way to have the things we want from our life is to start doing those things ourselves. The same is true when we want to see changes in the lives of others.\nDo you want a household that\u2019s less angry and more happy? Turn the other cheek, bury your own acid tongue, and make an effort to have a happier household.\nDo you want friends that are reliable and trustworthy and reflect the values you aspire to? Actively seek out new friends and spend less time with the friends that drag you down.\nDo you want your family to start building a positive net worth? Stop spending money on unnecessary things, do more things yourself, and talk about those changes you\u2019re actually doing.\nIf you want a life that\u2019s different than the life you currently have, you can\u2019t expect it to happen without you doing anything to cause it.\nYou need to step up to the plate with your own actions and personal changes. Without that, you can\u2019t really expect other people or other aspects of your life to change merely because that\u2019s what you want.\nLook around your life at the elements you\u2019re unhappy with. In almost every case, there are things you can do to make them better.\nHave a relationship you wish could be patched up? Swallow some pride and apologize for whatever\u2019s happened between you.\nWant to start having money in your checking account at the end of the month? Stop buying as much stuff that you don\u2019t really need.\nWant to have a deeper relationship with your spouse? Spend more time with your spouse, even if that means spending less time on your personal interests and more time involved with their interests for the short term.\nBe the change you want to see in your world. If you want something different, it\u2019s up to you to get the ball rolling with actions, not with mere words. Don\u2019t expect that you can tell others to change their lives merely to suit you.", "label": 1}
{"text": "How I define myself\nYou may recall from my last post that I made a list of all the things that make me, me. Well, I was trying to figure out how to incorporate \u201chow I define myself\u201d into that post, but the truth is, a top 5 list isn\u2019t going to cut it here.\nI\u2019m at a place in my life where I\u2019m incredibly comfortable with who I am. It took me nearly 30 years to get to this place, but knowing that some people never achieve this level of comfort with themselves, I feel pretty good about that.\nAs someone who participates in handful of activities that others like to judge (read: skydiving, tattoos, EDM raves, etc) I\u2019ve found that it\u2019s actually easier to feel good about the things you do when you find yourself in situations that require you to defend you actions.\nNow, that said, you also quickly learn that it\u2019s completely unnecessary to defend the things that make you happy to others. People love to hate. They LOOOOVE it. So don\u2019t let people who say shit like \u201cwhy would you want to do that?\u201d about anything, make you think for even a second that maybe you shouldn\u2019t. They\u2019re just projecting. They\u2019re scared, or some other shit, and because they can\u2019t bring themselves to do it they think you shouldn\u2019t either. Walk away. Those people don\u2019t support you \u2013 there are plenty of people out there who will, even if they don\u2019t have tattoos, skydive, go to raves, etc.\nHaving the ability to embrace and own the parts of yourself that define who you are is great. But having the ability to recognize the imperfections and realizing that those things don\u2019t define you is pretty incredible.\nThat said, I wanted to visit a few of those things that really do define who I am every single day:\nMy life has been focused on my career for as long as I can remember. Even in high school all I wanted to was to be successful. I\u2019ve moved from Michigan to Texas to Ohio to Illinois to Georgia to New York and to multiple cities within these states chasing the next best career opportunity. I can\u2019t imagine my life any other way. Personal success is critical to my happiness and I have to say I\u2019m pretty proud of where I\u2019ve been able to go in the last 8 years. Can\u2019t wait to see where this path takes me in the next 8 years.\nI got my first tattoo when I was 20 years old. It\u2019s two interlocking hearts on my foot. I had a needle on my skin for all of 2 minutes to accomplish this. I got another one to symbolize my love for music. Then I waited years to get another. I thought I was done. Tattoos didn\u2019t define who I was at the time, it was just a \u201cphase,\u201d or so I thought. In recent years I\u2019ve gone from a chick who has tattoos to a tattooed chick. My tattoos tell a story of my life. When I look at them I have great memories and great stories to tell. Each comes from a time in my life where I felt strongly about something \u2013 something that defines me. My tattoos are my way of visually expressing the parts of me that make me who I am. Sometimes I get disapproving looks, stares and friends and family members who shake their head. I\u2019ve even been told that I don\u2019t look like a chick who would have tattoos. Other times I have people stop me on the street or in my office and want to see them closer, want to know more. Those are the moments I thrive. My tattoos are for me. But, like them or not, they\u2019re certainly not going anywhere \u2013 and there are more to come, you can count on that.\nHaving lived in numerous cities across the country, and visited dozens of others on business, I have gained an added appreciation for travel. I take any opportunity I can to visit places I\u2019ve never been. I like to take opportunities and turn them into travel experiences. For instance, when I go to Tomorrowland (in Belgium) this summer, I\u2019ll also be visiting Amsterdam and Germany \u2013 turning a 3-day festival into an exploration of Europe. This is just scratching the surface and I definitely need to go back, but at least I get to see more than I will in Boom, Belgium. I\u2019ve also been known to extend business trips over weekends in order to visit friends or explore new places.\nAs a girl you grow up thinking of fairy tales and princesses and having this perfect life with a perfect partner. With experience I\u2019ve realized that life is about personal success and if you can have people in your life that you can share those experiences with, life becomes even more amazing. Relationships, whether friends, family or significant others, are mutually beneficial \u2013 or at least they should be. You have each others backs, you love each other to the extent that being there for them is not a burden but a role you\u2019re happy to fill. I take a lot of pride in my ability to love others to this extent. I have a lot of love to give and those who are in my life see and understand this \u2013 and hopefully, cherish it.\nI have amazing friends. The ones who live in NYC and the ones who don\u2019t. I\u2019m so incredibly lucky to have the people in my life that I do, and honestly, I\u2019m proud to call them friends. I\u2019ve learned over the years that I don\u2019t let people into the \u201cfriend zone\u201d unless they\u2019ve earned it. And I\u2019ve also learned when to remove people from that zone that don\u2019t deserve it. Friends do, with the exception of a special few, come and go. But the impact they have on your life in the time they\u2019re there is invaluable.\nI joke that I\u2019m the \u201cblack sheep\u201d of my family, and for the most part that\u2019s true. Not only have I \u201cmoved away\u201d from home but I continue to move around the country to chase experiences. I skydive, I have tattoos, I\u2019m divorced, I go to raves and spend my money on experiences rather than \u201csaving for retirement.\u201d Regardless, my family continues to stand behind me. They support me when I need it the most and are there to let me know they\u2019re there if I need them. I\u2019m closer with my parents than I\u2019ve ever been even though we live hundreds of miles away. I\u2019m lucky to be able to return home for visits and say that my blood relatives are pretty \u201cnormal,\u201d whatever that means.\nI saved this one for last because, well, it\u2019s pretty obvious. This is my 5th season as a skydiver. Being a \u201cskydiver\u201d is something that has changed over time. At first it was \u201ccool\u201d and now it\u2019s about being a part of this amazing community, always having people who get you and get why you jump. It\u2019s about the freedom you experience with each and every jump. It\u2019s about pushing yourself, your limits and having as much fun as you possibly can. The sky is my playground and with each jump I feel a little bit closer to my 8-year-old self.\nSo tell me, what defines you?\nBlue skies!\nPursuit of Happiness\nMoments of clarity tend to come to me at all times of the day. Today, it was on the stair climber at the gym, where I effectively wrote most of this post. Hope you enjoy!\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to hear skydivers word vomiting about the importance of following your dreams \u2013 doing and living what you love. After all, we found our passion and want nothing more than to see the rest of the world seeking out theirs. Really, we only do this with the best of intentions.\nBut let\u2019s be honest, for most of us, and even those who preach about living their passion, it\u2019s not all unicorns shitting rainbows over here. Nothing is perfect all time time. It\u2019s about balance. We have decisions to make to get us to our optimal level of happiness. As i see it, so long as the positive outweighs the negative, regardless of how that ratio fluctuates day-to-day or even moment-to-moment, I\u2019m all good.\nI tend to see life as a series of events rather than an ongoing stream of consciousness. This outlook allows me to pull happiness into my life in multiple ways throughout the day. I\u2019m not an all or nothing girl, so if something doesn\u2019t work out at 9am, my day isn\u2019t shot, there\u2019s still plenty more opportunity to have an amazing day \u2013 this also keeps me in check from allowing one let down to spiral out of control into a bad mood that lasts longer than anyone around me would prefer.\nEvery day I make it a point to do something I love \u2013 often multiple things. I guess that\u2019s easy to do when you have so many things in life that make you happy. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, I couldn\u2019t \u201cquit life\u201d to become a skydiver because I like diversity in my every day\u2026not to mention that I\u2019m not ready to make my hobby into a job. As one friend said to me recently \u201cmake anything \u2018work\u2019 and it takes just a little bit of the awesomeness out of it.\u201d I prefer to stay in awe of this sport and this community every day. Jaded can wait.\nBut back to happiness here\u2026.\nFinding ways to fold those activities that make me happy into each day is my key to sanity and keeping that positive to negative ratio in my favor. Here are just a few things that, at the end of the day, make me smile.\nIt\u2019s not just coincidental that I\u2019m here, sharing a few times each week with y\u2019all. As much as I love keeping this community satisfied, let\u2019s be honest, I\u2019m here for me too. Writing is cathartic. It\u2019s how I sort through my thoughts, how I make sense of the craziness going on in my head sometimes. By writing it down, I\u2019m able to sort through the crap to find the meat of my thoughts. I attribute my ability to reflect, learn and grow every day from my writing. It\u2019s by far my best creative outlet. (If I haven\u2019t said it lately, thanks for sharing it with me.)\nThere\u2019s a running joke that I have a hug quota, but sometimes I really believe it to be true. Sometimes, a hug can just make everything better.\nSharing laughs with over a beer\nWhether it\u2019s on a patio after work or around the bonfire at the dropzone after a day of skydiving, spending this type of time with my friends is crucial to my happiness. Now, for those who have been paying attention, I have to call myself out on this before you do \u2013 yes, I realize I\u2019m a bit of a hypocrite here. Earlier this year I wrote about a friend of mine who criticized me for not having a social life because I wasn\u2019t out at the bars every night after work. I still stand behind the fact that I don\u2019t need to go out and drink every night to consider myself social, and that I\u2019d rather put the money spent on $7 beers toward skydiving, but I will admit that after first moving to Atlanta I was a bit of a hermit. I was going through some personal crap and the last thing I wanted was to be out with other people while I had a lot to work through on my own. That said, I do understand the value, and often the need, to have this quality time with friends over a beer or three. I\u2019m so lucky to have the friends I do here and am incredibly thankful for the packed social schedule it provides. I\u2019ve never felt so much like myself as I do now.\nGym time\nThat said, I value my Ashley time immensely. A gym membership is always one of those things I\u2019ve struggled with because, honestly, I don\u2019t want to spend the money every month. That\u2019s two extra skydives people! Truth is, I need that time at the gym. Instead of taking \u201cme time\u201d on the couch cuddling with the dog as my brain turns to mush in front of the TV, I\u2019m able to do some cardio and lift some weights while I work through the thoughts in my head.\nI like to feel good about myself, and when I\u2019m doing things to push my mind and improve my body, I leave the experience exhausted yet feeling amazing knowing I\u2019ve accomplished something. Challenge makes me happy \u2013 hence picking up a sport like skydiving. And we can\u2019t forget about those endorphins. There\u2019s a reason I start every morning by heading to the gym \u2013 it sets the tone for the day and gives me a nice little kick start. Lately I\u2019ve even found myself heading back there after work if I don\u2019t have other plans. Why sit around surfing the channels when I could be doing something positive for myself instead, right?\nOf course, that doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t like my downtime. Aside from Thursday nights (because let\u2019s be honest, that\u2019s the best TV night), I often find myself curling up with a good book. Sometimes there\u2019s just nothing better than losing yourself in another reality with a good novel. Although lately I\u2019ve found myself craving non-fiction as well. I like to soak up knowledge on things like psychology, human behavior and of course skydiving. Sometimes even a good magazine will do \u2013 subscriptions to Blue Skies Mag, Psychology Today, Women\u2019s Health and Parachutist keep me happy there.\nIt\u2019s amazing what even 10 minutes of deep breathing and focusing on your body can do for your emotional well being.\nQuality time with my dog\nWhether it\u2019s going to the dog park, out on a walk around the neighborhood or chilling on the couch, my dog always puts me in a happy place. Every day she makes me laugh, and for that I am grateful.\nAt the gym, reading, cleaning, at work\u2026.these are just a few of the times you\u2019ll find me with ear buds in and jamming along to the appropriate tunes for the circumstances. Blasting music and singing at the top of my lungs is the only way I get through chores and long drives. Music has played a big role in my life for as long as I can remember. I was a \u201cband geek\u201d even through college. I have a music inspired tattoo. I am often found tapping my fingers, my feet, my hands along to a rhythm that only I can hear inside my head. Something about music touches my soul and there\u2019s always a song to put me into whatever state I desire most. It\u2019s amazing how influential music really is in my life.\nThe smell of pumpkin and lavendar\nLet\u2019s be honest, we\u2019ve touched on most of the other senses here\u2026you can\u2019t ignore that scent can be quite mood altering. Something as simple as lighting a lavender candle in my house can be enough to calm the day and put me in a happy place.\nWhat\u2019s that? Did I really just say work? That thing that everyone is trying to escape so they can live their lives? Well, to be honest, I enjoy a solid day of work. Productivity makes me happy. I feel satisfied after tackling those items on my to-do list. I often find myself volunteering to help out with events \u2013 hence my up-and-coming philanthropy consulting that we\u2019ll be talking more about in the coming months. I rep for Deepseed not just because I love their products but because it gives me something to pursue while on the ground at the dropzone. When friends have projects they need help with, I\u2019m the first to lend a hand. At the end of the day, if I\u2019ve accomplished something I can be proud of, I\u2019m happy.\nHaving something to look forward to is critical in my life. I love traveling to new places, jumping at new dropzones, testing out different wind tunnels, or even just going to visit friends in a new city. Variety definitely is the spice of life.\nMaking others happy\nIt makes me happy to put a smile on someone\u2019s face. I\u2019m always happy to help out a friend in need or do something out of my comfort zone to make someone else happy. I\u2019ve been known to be that random stranger on the street who compliments someone when they look like they\u2019re having a rough morning \u2013 after all, that may be the nicest thing they hear all day.\nYou didn\u2019t think i was going to leave that off the list, did you? Freefall is my happy place. Skydiving is by far my biggest passion and if I could, I\u2019d do it every day for the rest of my life.\nSo tell me, what makes YOU happy?\nLove and Blue Skies!\nOn making tough decisions\nLife is full of decisions. Whether you know it or not, you\u2019re making them every day: everything from how many times to hit the snooze button, to the type of creamer you\u2019re going to put in your coffee, to the time you decide to go to bed.\nThese don\u2019t seem like decisions, however, because most often when someone refers to a \u201cdecision\u201d it\u2019s because it\u2019s a pretty big deal (and you know, worth talking about, because no one else really cares how many times you hit snooze yesterday).\nIt\u2019s the big decisions, those that have the ability to change the course of our life, that stand out most. They take time and energy to make. Knowing a decision has the potential to change your life, there may even be rounds of deliberation with friends to help solidify your thoughts.\nWhat I\u2019ve found, though, is that often, whether people know it or not, these seemingly tough decisions really aren\u2019t all that hard to make \u2013 it\u2019s the action to move forward with the decision that becomes the challenge. When I speak with friends who want advice, by the time they get to me, I can usually tell that they\u2019ve already made up their mind but are simply having a hard time taking that first step in the right direction. It\u2019s like they have come to a fork in the road, know they want to veer left, but it\u2019s such a different path than the one they were just on, they need to stop and reflect before they can proceed.\nWhen I see this happen with others, I truly appreciate the process they\u2019re going through. I\u2019ve been there myself on a number of occasions, and the theme tends to be the same: decision time, gut tells you one thing, head may or may not tell you another, you know to follow your gut and a period of waiting happens \u2013 whether mere minutes or even months \u2013 there\u2019s typically a period of hesitation when it comes to acting\u2026especially if your decision impacts other people.\nAs a skydiver, I have learned that sometimes you can\u2019t follow logic, you can\u2019t make a decision based on what the butterflies in your stomach are telling you. Rather, decisions based on a feeling, a sense that this is just something you should do, often ends up being the right path. The truth is, whatever road you travel, there will be positive and negative outcomes along the way \u2013 that\u2019s just called life. The real challenge is making the choice to focus on the positive, find the good in the bad, learn from the hardships and apply those to the rest of your life so you can truly live the life you\u2019ve always dreamed.\nStill stuck on a tough decision? I can promise you the answer isn\u2019t in that self-help book, it\u2019s not what your friends or family think is best, it\u2019s what your gut is telling you. Quiet your mind, find a place to be alone and really listen \u2013 you\u2019ll find the answer, and the strength to make all your dreams come true. Have patience with yourself, take the time you need and act. In the end, the path to the left isn\u2019t all that scary after all.\nLove and blue skies!\nSelfish Dreams\nOh hi, I\u2019m back. Sorry for the delay here. I know y\u2019all are probably expecting an update regarding the success of Jump for Diabetes \u2013 it was huge (that\u2019s what she said) \u2013 but I\u2019m still working on compiling photos and video and getting the last of the donations tallied before we make any official statements on this year\u2019s events.\nThat said, I didn\u2019t want y\u2019all to think I completely fell off the blogging map, so I wanted to swing by and say hi.\nMy head is swimming from the weekend as you might imagine. Fifteen skydives in three days where the average temperature was 100 degrees will wear anyone out. But it was a great weekend with great friends and believe it or not I already can\u2019t wait till next year to see everyone again. Or, you know, the next time I decide to make a trip to Skydive Chicago for shits and giggles.\nNow that I\u2019m back on solid ground, and back to the grind, I\u2019ve found myself spending a lot of time reflecting on my life for the past half decade or so. Skydiving has taught me so much about the person I am and what I\u2019m capable of accomplishing, but there have been so many other \u201clife lessons\u201d learned in my 20s. Some of these lessons were harder than others, but all continue to have an impact on my decisions day-to-day.\nIt really is true that the human spirit is stronger than you think, and especially for me, I continue to find more strength each and every day.\nI\u2019m looking forward to the next few months that I\u2019ve already dedicated as me time. I intend to be selfish, to take care of my needs and wants before that of others \u2013 not only do I need this, I\u2019ve earned it. There\u2019s no doubt that this will come as a surprise to some, others likely won\u2019t believe it till it affects them, and I\u2019m even sitting here right now wondering how it\u2019s all going to unfold. Truth be told, I don\u2019t really care if I disappoint or even piss people off a bit, I\u2019m tired of always putting myself behind the \u201cneeds\u201d of others, because the truth is, if I can live my life without relying on the time and effort of those around me in the same way that those closest to me often do, then they\u2019ll survive while I take care of me for a while.\nSo what\u2019s this time look like? To be honest, I\u2019m not entirely sure, but in my mind I see lots of yoga, travel, cuddling with my dog, reading, writing and of course skydiving. Quality time with friends and family, new adventures, standing my ground with what I need and want \u2013 these are the things my selfish dreams are made of. I am truly excited for what lies ahead.\nWhat does the rest of your summer look like?\nBlue skies!\nDispelling the myths\nA recent article on a death in the world of skydiving (though rare, it does happen unfortunately) has the media up in arms over an industry that has \u201calmost no regulation.\u201d\nHello USPA, I hope you\u2019re all over this reporter like white on rice!\nOkay, so tact and sharing the facts in a calm, straight-forward manner is probably best, but needless to say when I read this I was slightly more than pissed.\nThere are so many myths out there about our sport just like this (thanks to my Facebook and Twitter followers for sending me additions for the list), so I thought it would be a great idea to take a few moments to review the top myths about the skydiving industry and provide you with the simple facts. The more the public knows, the better reputation our sport will have, so please feel free to point anyone who is speaking any of the following statements in the direction of this post.\nGiven recent media backlash against us skyjumpers, let\u2019s start here:\nSkydiving has little to no regulation\nSkydiving is regulated by a group called the United States Parachute Association (other countries have similar regulating bodies). The USPA works very closely with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to determine all kinds of safety protocol that must be followed by dropzones, skydivers, instructors and jump pilots at USPA-affiliated dropzones. We all have certain requirements we have to meet and tests we have to pass in order to receive our USPA license(s) and there\u2019s even more hoops to jump through in order to coach and instruct.\nEach year there are new regulations added as the sport changes, to include requirements and safety protocol for things like camera flying and wingsuiting. The FAA even does regular, drop-in spot checks and ride-alongs on jump planes to ensure that rules are being followed and that the dropzone operation is safe. If the protocol that is set in place by these regulating bodies is not followed, it is not uncommon to see jumpers and pilots stripped of their ratings.\nSkydiving is inherently dangerous\nYou regularly hear instructors at dropzones telling their students after a skydive to, \u201cdrive safe, it\u2019s the most dangerous thing you\u2019ll do today.\u201d Now that my friends, is a fact.\nAre there risks in skydiving? Yes, of course! But there are risks in most things you do in life, especially activities like driving. Skydiving comes with a whole host of safety features that the rest of life doesn\u2019t provide. For starters, you have TWO parachutes. Heaven forbid something goes wrong with your first canopy deployment, you can cut it away and use your reserve which is packed and inspected every 180 days by a certified, professional rigger. Not only that, you\u2019re surrounded by other skydivers who have gone through rigorous training to receive their licenses and ratings, so everyone is looking out for everyone else \u2013 in the air and on the ground. We all perform safety checks on our gear and we regularly get second and third checks from our fellow jumpers prior to exiting the aircraft. Dropzones designate landing patterns so that there\u2019s limited risk of incident on landing. I could go on and on about all the safety elements involved in skydiving, but it\u2019d just bore you.\nSkydiving\u2019s safety record only continues to improve as equipment and training advances. Don\u2019t believe me? Check out the facts in these charts from the USPA.\nThe problem is, the media sits around and waits to report on and (to take a word out of my buddy Chris\u2019 mouth) sensationalizes accidents, as if it\u2019s something that occurs regularly. Most incidents that occur in the sport are not due to equipment failure but happen under perfectly functioning canopies. These accidents can be due to jumpers performing high-performance moves that either they are not prepared for due to lack of experience, or simply because of a miscalculation in their maneuver. So yes, accidents happen, just as in every other real-world experience, but that\u2019s the risk you take simply by living people!\nThere\u2019s a high risk of your parachute not opening\nIt\u2019s not uncommon to hear the media talk about incidents, whether they ended in minor injury or even death, as the result of a parachute \u201cnot opening,\u201d which then leads people to believe that will likely happen if they skydive. Of course, this isn\u2019t how it went down, but getting the facts and understanding the physics behind how equipment works will clear things up a bit.\nWithout getting all science-y here (there is a lot of science involved in the sport, so the more you understand how everything works, like how planes stay up in the air and why parachutes want to fly, the more equip you\u2019ll be to handle issues and to control your fear for the unknown). Parachutes want to open. They are designed to open. So, if your parachute is packed properly, it will come out of the rig and out of the bag it\u2019s housed in smoothly, and open. There are malfunctions that can cause your parachute to malfunction once it\u2019s open \u2013 most of which are quickly correctable \u2013 and there are some issues that could cause your rig to not open properly, requiring the jumper to use their reserve, but again, these are very infrequent.\nThe truth is, when you hear someone say \u201ctheir parachute didn\u2019t open,\u201d what they mean to say is \u201cthey had a malfunction and had to use their reserve\u201d but they didn\u2019t do their research to find out what the actual problem was or they simply want to make the issue sound worse to make their story more compelling.\nWhatever the reason, it leads people to believe that a parachute not opening is something that frequently happens in our sport and leads to death or serious injury. Though issues are infrequent, all jumpers, whether instructors, camera fliers or fun jumpers, are all prepared to deal with malfunctions and sticky situations as they happen, leading to the continued improvement of our sport\u2019s safety record year after year.\nSkydiving is for crazy, suicidal thrill seekers\nSkydivers are just like everyone else. We are passionate about what we do. Sometimes to the extreme (read: jumpers who quit their lives, move to the dropzone and pack parachutes to keep food on the table) but those jumpers are credited for following their dreams and pursuing their passions more than anything. Given that we are driven by our passion for the sport, we are far from suicidal \u2013 we love life too much to want it to end. We crave that next moment in freefall, we want nothing more than to spend as much time as we can with our fellow jumpers in our big, blue playground.\nSome of us aren\u2019t even thrill seekers. Sure, a number of skydivers are \u2013 they\u2019re BASE jumpers, snowboarders, ground launchers, you name it \u2013 but some of us are in the sport not for the thrill \u2013 the adrenaline, but for the peace, the serenity, the stress relief that each jump provides. The challenges are never ending and the personal growth that\u2019s possible is amazing. We love being in a community of people who get why we do what we do and the overwhelming support that comes along with that. And as far as the \u201ccrazy\u201d part goes \u2013 aren\u2019t we all, in our own right, a little bit crazy?\nYou can have full-on conversations in freefall\nImagine being on a motorcycle, driving 120 mph down the highway and trying to have a conversation with the person on the motorcycle next to you. Now, remove the sound of the motorcycle from this scenario and what do you have left? A shit ton of wind, that\u2019s what. There is no way that anyone would be able to carry on a conversation as they move through the air at these speeds. And why would you? The gestures, the docking, the playing is so much fun in and of itself, there\u2019s no need for words.\nFreefall lasts for minutes at a time\nThis myth, along with the one above is perpetuated by movies like Point Break, where skydives seem to last for minutes. This is for dramatic effect only. The average freefall portion of a skydive lasts between 45 and 60 seconds, depending on your exit altitude and which type of discipline you\u2019re practicing. Of course, you can add an extra 30-60 seconds for wingsuit jumps, and none of this time includes your canopy ride, but the point here is that you can\u2019t talk in freefall and you\u2019re only there for a minute, max.\nNow that I have done a tandem, I can start wingsuiting\nI debated whether or not to include this in the list, but truth be told, some of the dumbest things come out of the mouths of some of the most intelligent people when it comes to skydiving, so I thought it best to address.\nSo you\u2019ve done a tandem, or even your first AFF jump. Good for you! You\u2019ve experienced something less than 1% of the population has or ever will experience. That said, you\u2019re no expert. In fact, you have no concept of what it means to fly a wingsuit. I know, you\u2019ve seen videos on YouTube of proximity flying and it doesn\u2019t look all that hard, right?\nAgain, I say, false. The USPA requires that you have at least 200 skydives to start wingsuiting. You need to understand skydiving before adding a discipline of this magnitude to your repertoire. Most dropzones now have wingsuit schools to ensure these regulations are followed and to provide jumpers with a first flight course that gives them adequate instruction on how to fly your body and what to do in an emergency situation. It takes time, experience, and understanding of the sport to fly a wingsuit. Worry about getting your A-license first, then we can talk disciplines.\nWhen a parachute opens after freefall, you shoot up into the sky\nThis is an illusion. When a jumper is being filmed, whether it\u2019s a tandem skydive or a solo jump, and they deploy their parachute, the camera man who is shooting the video is not deploying their parachute at the same time. So, assuming you\u2019re both falling at 120 mph in freefall, the camera man continues falling at that speed while your parachute slows you down, making it appear on video that you\u2019re shooting back up into the sky.\nPeople who are afraid of heights can\u2019t skydive\nIf you\u2019ve flown in an airplane you know what the ground looks like from thousands of feet up. Little squares of land and tiny specs that are houses, cars, etc. The truth is, the average person cannot tell a difference in altitude until they are less than 1,500 feet above the ground, at which point you should be under a well functioning canopy and traveling at a much slower rate toward the ground.\nWhat does this mean? No ground rush!\nWhy is that important? Because when you think of fear of heights you picture standing at the edge of a cliff, or off a bridge or something similar where the ground is close enough that if you fall, you\u2019ll see the ground coming toward you.\nWith skydiving, you don\u2019t get that. In skydiving, there is no sensation of falling, no jumpy stomach feeling like you get on a roller coaster or when bungee jumping. You won\u2019t lose your stomach \u2013 that too, is a myth.\nI know plenty of jumpers who are petrified of standing on a ladder but are more than thrilled to be jumping from an airplane \u2013 so long as it\u2019s thousands of feet up!\nSkydivers jump out of \u201cperfectly good airplanes\u201d\nThere is no such thing as a perfectly good airplane. In that same breath, there\u2019s no such thing as a perfectly good instructor, a perfectly good pilot, or a perfectly good student. This is why there is a risk in skydiving. No situation is perfect, but if you\u2019re properly trained and prepared to make the skydive (read: you have your fear in check and your adrenaline is working for you instead of against you) then it\u2019s an incredibly safe sport.\nThe only way to understand what skydiving is like is to experience it yourself\nI wanted to throw a true statement in here for you. To take a page out of the book of fellow skydiver, DZO and all-around amazing person Rook Nelson, if you want to have an opinion on the sport of skydiving, you have to try it. You may only want to do it once, but at least then you\u2019re not being hypocritical when you speak of something you\u2019ve never actually experienced.\nAnything you think you know about skydiving but want to find the truth? Just ask.\nBlue skies!\nWhy I wear gloves when skydiving\nIt\u2019s summer here in Georgia, which means it\u2019s regularly 90+ degrees when I\u2019m out skydiving. Sweaty jumpers pack together into the plane for 60 seconds of air conditioning upon exit at 14,000 ft, and we\u2019re already sweating by the time we\u2019re back on the ground.\nNeedless to say it\u2019s not uncommon that I get looked at like I have two heads when I\u2019m putting on my skull cap and gloves as I\u2019m boarding the plane.\nNow, any woman skydiver knows just how critical a skull cap is in ensuring that you\u2019re not spending hours brushing out knots in your hair (or worse, cutting them out), after a day of skydiving \u2013 so not much justification takes place here\u2026but gloves, in the summer, really?!\nLet me just tell you, I\u2019ve jumped with and without gloves and regardless how hot and humid the weather, they\u2019ve proven to be a necessity. Here\u2019s why:\nProtection -\nIt never fails, the day I forget my gloves or think for one reason or another that they\u2019re not needed, I end up injuring my hands. We\u2019re talking scrapes, cuts and bruises here, nothing too serious, but enough to be annoying and usually leave me bleeding post-skydive. Rarely do I know exactly what happened \u2013 skydiving is sometimes a full contact sport, with fellow jumpers, the plane, the ground \u2013 but once I\u2019m back on the ground I\u2019m all \u201cthat stings, what the hell!\u201d\nThis weekend proved to be no different, thanks to my altimeter for gouging my paw!\nGrip -\nPersonally, I like having gloves for the added grip they provide. When you\u2019re skydiving with others, there will come a time where you\u2019re hanging outside of a moving aircraft with one hand on a bar keeping you attached to the plane while your fellow jumpers get set up to exit. With gloves, I have confidence I\u2019m not going to slip off. It\u2019s also nice to have gloves when it\u2019s pull time so slippage isn\u2019t an issue.\nWarmth -\nThis probably goes without saying but gloves provide a nice barrier between your skin and the elements. My skydiving gloves are less \u201cwintery\u201d and more the type you\u2019d find baseball players wearing (in fact, I picked them up from the baseball section of a sporting goods store if I remember correctly), but they still do the trick when it comes to weather protection \u2013 that is, unless it\u2019s below freezing at altitude, but that\u2019s an entirely different conversation.\nHere in the South, it still gets chilly at altitude, even when it\u2019s warm on the ground. And for someone who has circulation issues in her hands and feet, I don\u2019t need to worry about my fingers going numb on a skydive.\nIt\u2019s all what you\u2019re used to -\nHere\u2019s what it comes down to \u2013 personal preference. If you want to jump with gloves, if that\u2019s where you\u2019re comfortable, you know what it\u2019s like to grasp your hackey (we\u2019re talking skydiving here people) and exit with (or without) gloves, stick to what\u2019s comfortable. As a jumper who grew up at a dropzone in the North, it made sense to get comfortable wearing gloves \u2013 they were essential if you wanted to jump any time other than the dead of summer. In the end, only you can make this decision for you.\nSo tell me, do you wear gloves? Why, or why not?\nAnd ladies \u2013 thoughts on the skull cap? Totally critical in my book!\nBlue skies!\nFlying Tandem Camera \u2013 the beginning\nJust as I\u2019ve been known to do when starting a new journey, whether in the sky or on the ground, I want to start from the beginning talking about it here on the blog \u2013 if not to help others see the progression as it happened in real life, then simply as a reminder to myself where I\u2019ve been.\nThis weekend I began flying tandem camera. No, not in the sense that I\u2019ve got a full helmet cam set up and I\u2019m in a rotation, actually, not in the slightest \u2013 I prefer to start this out slow rather than go balls to the wall in my usual fashion.\nI was lucky enough to be working with a trusted tandem instructor and a couple of great camera fliers that didn\u2019t mind my lurking on their jumps. Within a few practice jumps I was seeing incredible progress, thanks to some serious pep talks and lessons from my fellow jumpers. Needless to say, I had moments of frustration and moments of excitement when I could see improvement happening. I never thought I\u2019d be this excited to jump with tandems, but there\u2019s something to be said for capturing that pure joy that a new skydiver experiences in the moment.\nOf course, this is just the very beginning for me, but I wanted to share a few lessons from my weekend in the sky with a camera on my head, serving a purpose greater than capturing my fellow freeflyers as they cheese the camera (as fun as that is)!\nLesson 1 \u2013 Spend time on your belly early on in your skydiving career.\nFor anyone who is thinks they might want to fly camera some day, heed this suggestion, spend time on your belly! As a young jumper I was told by so many more experienced skydivers to do work on my belly before transitioning to freeflying (and they meant more than 30 skydives, turns out), and it seems that I\u2019m running into all kinds of situations in the sky where more belly time would have been helpful.\nNow, I\u2019m not saying you need to start a 4-way team or anything, but being comfortable and proficient belly to Earth is key when flying tandem video. Those things that are instinctual for people who have spent a couple hundred jumps working on their RW skills seem to take me a bit longer to get to in the sky \u2013 like stopping backsliding (hello Superman arms, those don\u2019t get you anywhere but backwards). That said\u2026\nLesson 2 \u2013 Be an all-around proficient skydiver.\nThis weekend, most of my fellow camera fliers were also freeflyers in their downtime. Being comfortable in a sit was key for me for a couple reasons.\n1) If the tandem instructor is taking a bigger passenger, it helps to have some sit/back skills so you can contort quickly into these freefly positions to keep up if folding in half on your belly isn\u2019t cutting it in terms of freefall rate.\n2) You have to be ready for anything. When a tandem exits, for the first couple seconds they are falling with the weight of two people, that is, until the drogue is released. If you\u2019re anything like me, exits are going to take some time to get down. What I found this weekend is that if I don\u2019t leave just a split second before the tandem I end up above them till the drogue is out. Of course, that puts you in a position where you might just find the drogue coming at you! Yep, that happened. Luckily, I was able to flip to my sit just in time to get out of the way and get back in front of the tandem. Not every exit is going to be perfect, but you have to know how to deal with it and make it the best you can.\nLesson 3 \u2013 Start slow with your equipment.\nAfter one day in the air with my new camera on my head, I woke up on day two with an incredibly stiff neck. I have to admit, I was surprised by this as my camera isn\u2019t all that heavy and you practically can\u2019t even tell it\u2019s on your head in the air. That said, my neck isn\u2019t used to any weight aside from my Bonehead REvolve, so any added weight creates strain, especially on opening. I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t add the weight of a still camera at the same time, I doubt I\u2019d be able to hold my head up right now if I had.\nLesson 4 \u2013 Video editors are your best friends.\nWhen you\u2019re running to catch the next load, you head to the video room to drop off your SD card and let the editors work their magic to send the tandem student home happy with their footage. They make it easy for you to have work you\u2019re proud of and allow you to drop your files and run. Granted, aside from a few seconds of footage, none of my work was sold this weekend, but after two long days at the dropzone, the last thing I wanted was to pick up my computer and start editing \u2013 hence, no video footage to share.\nHopefully in the next few weekends I\u2019ll have more tandem video awesomeness to show.\nLove and blue skies!\nThrowing Caution to the Wind\nAll weekend I looked forward to getting back in the sky after nearly a month on the ground. I wanted to test out those skills I learned in the tunnel with Mickey. Saturday and Sunday were out due to other obligations \u2013 and a need to just relax after a fairly stressful week \u2013 so when Monday came I was up before dawn ready to hit the road for The Farm.\nUpon arrival the winds appeared to be cooperating, however the uppers were bookin\u2019 a bit. Of course, after the Good Vibes boogie this weekend, people were a bit slow to get up and around, to say the least. By the time load 1 was ready to head up, I decided to stay planted on the ground because of wonky winds.\nAs I\u2019ve said countless times before, I\u2019m the epitome of a wind pussy. In fact, this was even a discussion on a recent episode of Skydive Radio where Brian Germain discussed small people under small canopies (Episode #171 if you\u2019re interested in hearing more about the topic). It\u2019s something I\u2019ve struggled with since day 1, and I\u2019ve come to appreciate my healthy fear of the wind and keep myself planted on the ground when they get sketchy.\nThat said, I figured something out about myself this weekend that, deep down I already knew, but will likely help me get off the ground more in the future. When I\u2019ve had a decent amount of time off from jumping, I let my butterflies get the best of me and I find ways to make excuses. Take yesterday for example: yes, the winds were sketchy till about 1pm, but then after that I didn\u2019t like the amount of big, puffy clouds in the sky because of possible turbulence. I was nervous about catching a thermal as I come over the trees to land. There were lots of newbie jumpers in the sky pulling at all different heights, some where pulling at 5,000 and they were out before me. And on and on\u2026\nFinally, I shook my head, looked up at the sky, and took the offer to get on that 15 minute call.\nOf course, the jump went swimmingly and I was back up in the air on the next load. Sure, thermals were a bit of an issue and there was some turbulence around 2 grand, but these are all things that I know how to deal with, especially that high off the ground. And yes, there were some newbie canopy fliers out, but as long as you\u2019re aware of it and are aware of where they are, and are confident in your own canopy skills and awareness, you can avoid any potential situations \u2013 after all, regardless of experience level of the other canopy pilots around you, you should be on the lookout for someone who might take you out.\nMy point \u2013 ask yourself where caution ends and excuses begin. I found that with me, it\u2019s easy to fall into the idea that \u201cthe winds are crap so I won\u2019t be jumping today\u201d and mentality changes. Don\u2019t let your mind run your life \u2013 just because you think it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true.\nWe\u2019re skydivers. We know we can do it. Trust your gut and feel confident that the skydive will go as planned. Odds are, it will.\nBlue Skies!\nSky bath \u2013 a cleansing of the soul\nAfter nearly half a year with my feet on the ground, I\u2019m happy to say I made a successful return to the sky this weekend \u2013 despite Mother Nature\u2019s best attempts at keeping me grounded.\nEarly last week at physical therapy I was officially cleared to skydive. The caveat was that I had to feel really good to make a jump. Needless to say when I woke up on Friday and my shoulder was feeling a bit \u201ccrunchy,\u201d I was concerned that my return would have to be postponed yet again. Luckily come Saturday morning the only pains I awoke with were the painful cravings to sky jump.\nAs I arrived at The Farm (which is my new home dropzone after moving to The South) the winds were not playing as nice as I\u2019d hoped. The swoop competitors who were in town for the FLCPA swoop meet were grounded due to gusty winds, so that was my indication to keep my feet firmly plated on the ground.\nSo, I took the time to plan my first jump back, do some dirt diving, and even network a bit for Jump for Diabetes (more to come on that later). Once the winds stated behaving I got on the first load that would take me \u2013 an hour and 1/2 later. Lucky for me it ended up being the sunset load. Simple two way freefly, knee lock into sit, where I got to test out all those skills I refined in the tunnel over the winter. One foot dock and lots of smiles later it was time to pull. Thankfully, I decided to pull high as my deployment included a number of line twists that required some deep breathing and lots of kicking. All was good in the end.\nThe sky was wonderful and peaceful, it was the cleanse that I needed. It\u2019s amazing how much lighter I feel after a good skydive. All my cares and worries are left in the door of that airplane and nothing else matters but the moment \u2013 it\u2019s like a cleansing of the soul.\nThe rest of the weekend didn\u2019t play nice wind wise, but lots of time was spent outside\u2026I\u2019ve got the sunburn and mosquito bites to prove it. All in all it was a great couple days and I can\u2019t wait to do it again next weekend.\nLove and blue skies!\np.s. It\u2019s been a while since you\u2019ve seen one of these on my blog, but here\u2019s a look at my first flight back!", "label": 1}

Xinjiang itself borders Central Asia, Pakistan and Afghanistan.\nChen's base is also home to a detachment of advanced HQ-7B short-range anti-aircraft missiles, though they were not put in front of the cameras as they were off-base at a training exercise, the commander said.\nInstead, ageing anti-aircraft cannons dating from the 1960s were brought out, along with a slightly more modern version, and soldiers chatted amiably about their equipment and why they joined the army as they posed for pictures.\n\"Spending on the People's Liberation Army will rise 10.7 percent to 740.6 billion yuan ($120 billion) this year, a number many governments and analysts say is not representative of the country's true defense outlays.\nMore sensitive questions were studiously swatted away on the carefully organized visit.\nGeng Yansheng, the Chinese military's official spokesman who often appears in state media issuing missives on everything from relations with Japan to military spending, refused to talk about anything besides the day's activities.\n\"We can talk about all these things back in Beijing,\" Geng admonished reporters, when asked about tensions with Japan over a group of disputed islands in the East China Sea.\nChina wants to show its commitment to transparency by arranging such visits, he added.\n\"This visit shows how open we are ... But this openness is a gradual process,\" Geng said. \"We will continue to do this and open up more bases for visits.\"\n($1=6.1347 Chinese yuan)\n(Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)\nBest photos of the year 2013\nIn this showcase of some of Reuters' most memorable photos, the photographers offer a behind the scenes account of the images that helped define the year.

{"text": "Is Your Broker Taking Advantage of You?\nBrokers buy and sell stocks and securities upon your request. But these days, big losses have left many investors incensed and blaming their brokers for ignoring instructions and disregarding their risk tolerance.\nAnd so the battle begins.\nAccording to FINRA, Wall Street\u2019s own self-regulator, arbitration cases filed against brokers are up more than 85 percent just since last year. Pursuing a case requires painstaking proof of wrongdoing and even if you win it doesn\u2019t mean you will recoup all your losses. Investors typically recover just 40 percent of their money.\nThe better option is to know, precisely, what your broker can and cannot do with your money before you hand him or her the proverbial keys to your portfolio. John Gannon, senior vice president in the Office of Investor Education at FINRA, points out that first and foremost, every broker must be licensed with FINRA. If they aren\u2019t, you\u2019re in trouble.\nBrokers can make recommendations about specific investments and buy and sell those securities on your behalf, but they cannot engage in misconduct. That would include making unsuitable recommendations, executing trades without your authorization or misrepresenting or omitting anything about an investment they recommend.\nIf you find yourself unhappy with your broker\u2019s handling of your money, Gannon suggests the following:\n1. Contact the firm. If you are unhappy with a specific transaction the first step should always be to reach out to them. If you are unsatisfied with their response, you can contact the broker\u2019s branch manager or the compliance department within the firm. If you have lost money, make sure to put the complaint in writing and keep a copy of what you send.\n2. You also have the option of complaining directly to FINRA by filing a complaint here. This ensures that the agency can process your complaint quickly, Gannon says.\n3. If you still aren\u2019t satisfied, there is the option of arbitration. This is only for those who have lost money and believe that the firm or specific broker engaged in misconduct. It is NOT if you simply lost money because the market tanked. If you go this route, Gannon suggests first contacting an attorney that specializes in security issues.\nThe power is in the hands of the investor when it comes to their portfolios. Nearly 80 percent of those who are misled or defrauded don\u2019t report it, Gannon says, citing a FINRA Investor Education Study. Know what your broker can and cannot do on your behalf and fight back if, and only if, you feel you\u2019ve been taken advantage of.", "label": 1}

The photo appears, projected onto the canvas, and Richter begins to trace it with a piece of charcoal and a ruler. Tracing each minute detail of a photograph, as he does, usually takes Richter a couple of hours. Then he is ready to paint.An Artist Beyond Isms [nyt via john bailey]\n''Idiots can do what I do,'' he says, although of course he doesn't really think so. ''When I first started to do this in the 60's, people laughed. I clearly showed that I painted from photographs. It seemed so juvenile. The provocation was purely formal -- that I was making paintings like photographs. Nobody asked about what was in the pictures. Nobody asked who my Aunt Marianne was. That didn't seem to be the point.''\nThe point, among other things, was to distance himself from the clich\u00e9s of artistic expression -- all the spontaneous, fiery, warm and fuzzy modes of painting -- so as to make people really look and not reflexively swoon. By using deliberately banal photographs, impersonally mimicked, he was doing the exact opposite of what painting was expected to do, not grabbing a viewer by the lapels but methodically copying an everyday image. In time, some of the pictures have come to look expressively painted, perceptions having changed, but making methodical copies was Richter's intent.", "label": 1}

Co-chairman Lee Hamilton said it's not a matter of months, it should be weeks, even days, when change must take place.\n'The American people have asked for change both in our economy, in our budget priorities, and in the war in Iraq, and the Republicans in Congress are in disarray. They are going to leave a mess as they go out. It's been a do-nothing Congress and as they go out the door they are going to validate the decision of the American people that change was necessary - that we must have integrity, civility, fiscal soundness in how we operate the government and how we deliberate in Congress.\n'It's really sad. I've said it before and it seems even truer now: the Republicans never miss an opportunity, to miss an opportunity. They have an opportunity now to at least go out the door leaving the House in some level of order, but here we are the morning of the day that we are supposed to adjourn, within 24 hours and we have absolutely no idea what they are up to.\n'That will change.

Demonstrators accused police of overreacting.\nThe teachers want a 37% pay increase and some protesters want an end to \"automatic approval\" in state schools, which does not allow students to fail and can push them through to the next school year without merit.\n\"My school is abandoned, the principal does nothing and doesn't want to do anything,\" student Karoline Santana stated on an event page set up on Facebook.\n\"Teachers have even lost faith, and those who arrive full of hope see quickly that the joy of teaching doesn't exist anymore. Even the older teachers demotivate the new ones,\" she said.\nOn Oct. 7 protesters took to the streets in support of Rio de Janeiro's municipal and state system teachers, who have been on strike since August. Violence has continued to take over protests in Brazil, particularly in Sao Paulo and Rio, where members of Black Bloc organizations have been blamed for streaks of vandalism that lead to a violent police response that harmed peaceful protesters as well.\nIn June, a group of about 2,000 protesters known as the Movimento Passe Livre took to the streets to demand free public transportation in Sao Paulo. The peaceful protest quickly turned violent when police fired rubber bullets and used tear gas and pepper spray to disperse the crowd. Some were left seriously injured.\nThe police handling of the demonstration prompted more than 1 million people to protest across Brazil in subsequent nights. Sao Paulo's demonstrations peaked at 65,000 people in June, but steady protests continued across the country into July.\nCopyright 2013\nRead the original story: Protesters take to streets in Brazil", "label": 1}

{"text": "We\u2019re back to the arrow of time again: cnce the energy in a system begins to accelerate, for whatever reason, it cannot decelerate, but pushes relentlessly forward toward a bifurcation point.\nThat is what is happening in front of our very eyes on the world stage: since the end of the Second World War, the United States has moved toward ever-greater supremacy over the other countries of the world. For decades there was little appetite among its allies to counter its expansion, whether through manufactures, trade or finance. There were benefits for the ruling classes that to a greater or lesser degree trickled down to the rest of fast-growing societies, so the ruling classes looked the other way at the occasional abuse.\nOver the last decade they have become ever more uncomfortable with America\u2019s wars of aggression, limiting their participation to the minimum they could get away with and still benefit from handouts. Then came Wikileaks, and Private Bradley Manning and what appear to be trumped-up sexual charges against Julian Assange (which noone seems to have investigated in Sweden where they were put forth), and America\u2019s allies could only mutter disapproval at the methods being used against these whistle-blowers.\nThe Snowden saga has become a bifurcation point: it matters not where he ultimately finds sanctuary, for his latest revelations show that the United States crossed a red line from which it cannot turn back: spying on its allies to a degree hitherto unknown in international relations.\nThere are many, for sure, among the governing elites of the world who have been waiting for this moment, some without even being aware of it. For the first time in sixty years, the United States has become fair game, and the domestic advantages to stepping back from its orbit are too great in this time of austerity to overcome any remaining scruples.\nWe are witnessing the start of a great unraveling.\nIt is not as treasonous for USA to spy on USAns as it is for allied tyrants to allow their subjects to be spied on by USA.\nHow do you like being the sole superpower now?\nJust in the interest of precision, Assange is not charged with a crime in Sweden. He is wanted for questioning, his accuser says he had sex without a condom.\nHis position is that the Swedish government can come to the Ecuadoran Embassy any time and ask him all the questions they want. He sees the issue as a pretext to deliver him to the USA.\nThis is not a Dominique Strauss-Khan type of story.\nRemarkable how effective the repeated story is.", "label": 1}

Since then, the district had added nearly 1,300 more workstations, bringing the total to nearly 3,000. The network needed greater and more reliable bandwidth to handle this increase.\nThe school district partnered with Cox Business to provide high-speed Internet access through its fiber-optic network. After a year, however, the district wanted to offer more services to its schools. Cox Business smoothly transitioned the upgrade, which gave the district up to 10Mbps of bandwidth.\n\"Our Cox Business account and support team has been very responsive when we ask for changes, enhancements, or just call to kick around a few ideas,\" said Rick Van Leeuwen, Associate Director, Network Services. \"There have even been times when their engineers have assisted us with identifying and correcting problems that were either in our network or another ISP.\"\nThe school district is very pleased with the reliable, high-quality Internet service provided by Cox Business. \"They notify us well in advance of infrequent but necessary maintenance. The network is monitored 24/7 and if we notice something unusual and call, they are typically already looking into it,\" said Van Leeuwen.\nVan Leeuwen also noted that the new service has given the district the flexibility to develop new Web-based programs for students and the community. \"A student's entire experience with the colleges, from their first application to register through the first day of classes, can be accomplished entirely from the Internet. They never even have to set foot on campus,\" he explained. \"And once they're on-campus, we provide an 'Internet-enriched' learning environment. Cox Business helps us to make that a reality.\n\"Cox Business continues to bring new opportunities for their services to our attention, and we have collaborated on possible solutions to telephone, video conferencing and VPN (Virtual Private Network),\" he added. \"Combine that with the technical support we receive, and one just couldn't ask for more.\"", "label": 1}

This and so much more will be possible at the \u201cCaptured by a Compelling Narrative\u201d Conference on October 27 & 28.

Fluker, Bass and Slaughter all beg to differ with this common wisdom. Walter Fluker speaks of the potency of ethical leadership in inviting young people to consider lives filled with promise amidst the challenges of our time. Dr. Bass\u2019s study on sources of Protestant vitality provides us with a future filled with promise and more than the care and feeding of declining congregations. In her book Christianity for the Rest of Us Bass contends that the old \u201cneighborhood\u201d has been replaced by a strip mall and so the idea of neighborhood churches functioning as they once had is nonsensical \u2013 but these congregations are learning new and lively ways to serve. Slaughter shows that even in large and \u201csuccessful\u201d mega-church settings it is possible to pivot in dramatic new theological and ministry directions.\nThere is an old sociological aphorism to the effect that \u201cwhat we perceive to be real becomes real in its consequences.\u201d Craig Dykstra has spoken much about the power of lively imagination in shaping effective ministry. If we can perceive that there is abundant space for ministry, even in old settings, amazing and real things can happen. We will hear some of this from Fluker, Bass and Slaughter.

{"text": "Hey Pauline Hanson\u2019s mole, if you\u2019re reading this: please explain\n- Share\nPauline Hanson stands to lose a fortune in legal fees after the man who leaked her emails purporting to show a vote-rigging cover-up in the March NSW state election failed to show up in court yesterday. It now appears the whistleblower may not exist at all.\nThe plot thickened even further on Thursday afternoon when the Greens MP at the centre of the scandal revealed he has received phone calls from a fake Daily Telegraph journalist (see update at end of story).\nHanson\u2019s legal challenge rests on alleged email exchanges between the NSW Electoral Commission\u2019s chief information officer and communications manager suggesting counting by \u201cdodgy staff\u201d may have cost her up to 1200 votes.\nThe serial candidate was leaked the emails by \u201cMichael Rattner\u201d, a construction worker who says his girlfriend works at the NSW Electoral Commission.\nHanson\u2019s legal team appears to have taken a Descartes 2.0 approach to Rattner\u2019s existence: I Facebook, therefore I am.\n\u201cWe know he is a real person,\u201d Peter Lowe, Hanson\u2019s barrister, said yesterday. \u201cHe has a Facebook site. He has made postings on that website to Ms Hanson.\u201d\nHanson also says she has spoken to Rattner on the phone, but admits she has never met him in person. If Rattner does exist, he certainly is a man of mystery \u2014 not to mention one with ironically little regard for Australia\u2019s electoral laws. An electoral roll search by Crikey this morning showed there is no Michael Rattner enrolled to vote in Australia. There is also no M. Rattner listed in the White or Yellow Pages in Queensland or NSW. The Facebook page in question is set to private and does not display a profile picture.\nOvernight, obviously fake Facebook and Twitter profiles for a Michael Rattner \u2014 who lives in Cronulla and supports One Nation NSW \u2014 have also emerged.\nSpeaking outside court yesterday, the former One Nation leader admitted she may have been the victim of an \u201celaborate hoax\u201d.\nThe Greens\u2019 Jeremy Buckingham, who beat Hanson by 2437 votes in the final count, told Crikey this morning he thinks it \u201chighly unlikely\u201d that Rattner is a real person and \u201calmost certain\u201d the emails are fraudulent.\n\u201cPauline Hanson has based this incredibly contentious and expensive case on one email from one person who may or may not exist as a real person,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I wasn\u2019t in the middle of it I\u2019d think it was funny. It\u2019s a farce.\u201d\nBuckingham said if Hanson is not successful he will be pursuing her for his legal costs, which he estimates will come in at more than $20,000.\n\u201cShe\u2019s cast aspersions on me, my election and the democratic process in NSW \u2014 I think that\u2019s shameful,\u201d Buckingham said.\n\u201cI hope it\u2019s the end of Pauline Hanson. I hope she rides into the sunset and is never seen again.\u201d\nBuckingham\u2019s barrister, Tom Malomby SC, told the court Hanson\u2019s vote-rigging allegations, if true, would amount to a \u201dmassive, crack-brained conspiracy of extraordinary proportions\u201d.\nBack of the envelope calculations suggest Hanson could be close to $100,000 out of pocket if she has to cover the legal fees of the other defendants \u2014 Buckingham, the NSW Electoral Commission and Nationals MLC Sarah Mitchell \u2014 as well as her own.\nIn the emails sent to Hanson, the NSW Electoral Commission\u2019s chief information officer Ian Brightwell is purported to tell chief communications officer Richard Carroll to \u201cstonewall\u201d journalists asking questions about irregularities in Hanson\u2019s vote count.\n\u201cThank you for your inquiry regarding advice on media inquiries relating to today\u2019s pushing of the button for the upper house preferences. Just stonewall them as much as possible when it comes to Hanson and her issues with the count. Do not mention there is any possible provision for a recount,\u201d Brightwell allegedly wrote.\n\u201cWe know the media are looking at the blank ballots and are trying to get them all rechecked because one of her scrutineers was meant to of found some of her votes in among the blanks (I have heard through the chain that there could be as many as 1200 across the state that are in with the blanks as there were a few dodgy electoral staff on, but don\u2019t offer that).\u201d\nBrightwell and Carroll have signed affidavits saying they did not send the emails in question and the court was yesterday told Brightwell\u2019s email did not carry his usual e-signature.\nIf a hoaxer is at work, he has certainly played an elaborate game. The Australian journalist Leo Shanahan today writes that he has received several calls since the election from a Mr Rattner who says he is \u201cmerely a Labor voter trying to do the right thing\u201d.\nHanson wasn\u2019t giving up yesterday, even though her mole failed to show. \u201cI\u2019m asking Michael Rattner \u2026 Please stand by your word and come to court,\u201d she pleaded.\nRegular Crikey readers know we tend to be sceptical of media-driven campaigns but today we are making an exception. The integrity of the democratic system in our nation\u2019s most populous state is, after all, at stake.\nSo please, if you know a Michael Rattner then get in touch. Or at least tell him to show up at court next Thursday: a warrant is out in his name.\nAnd Rattner, if you\u2019re reading this, we have only two words for you: please explain.\nUPDATE: On Thursday afternoon Greens MP Jeremy Buckingham told reporters in Sydney that he had been repeatedly contacted by a fake Daily Telegraph journalist named Michael Wilson since the March 26 election. Two weeks ago \u201cWilson\u201d contacted Buckingham and told him that he could \u201crelax about the case\u201d because he had been speaking to Michael Rattner and knew that he would not appear in court.\n\u201cIn light of all the other information made available yesterday, it seems that Michael Wilson is the only person who knew how to contact Michael Rattner,\u201d Buckingham said. \u201dIt now seems to me that Michael Wilson is not only an imposter, but may be the same person as Michael Rattner.\u201d\nThe Greens MP also revealed that another fake Tele journalist, \u201cSean Castle\u201d, had requested vote count figures from the NSW Electoral Commission.\nBernard Keane How high-speed rail could destroy your suburb\nCrikey Packer\u2019s Sydney arts donation a lay-down misere\nCrikey Factional game: the inside story of NSW anti-abortion laws\nMatthew Knott Journalism crack: exposing the Daily Mail\u2018s dark arts\nMatthew Knott Dangerous rubbish: AFR letters ed lashed for contrarian climate paper\nMatthew Knott Greenwald: the spying, not the media, is the story\nThe name Godwin Grech comes to mind\u2026and don\u2019t believe your paranoid beliefs are realistic - do your homework first\u2026\nIf you\u2019re reading this I am dead set stuffed.\nAh Rattner, your true name is obviously Keyser S\u00f6ze.\nWouldn\u2019t you think that any lawyer worth his money, would have said \u201cwe can not take this to trial until we meet this man, and verify his claims\u201d???? What kind of legal representation is Hanson getting? How could they be that foolish? Or is this just one more massive publicity grab (at any cost\u2026 at a huge cost now it seems) by Ms Hanson?\nI am Michael Rattner.\nOh wait - no I\u2019m not! Right first name though.\nGroan!!! Pauline is at it again, publicity hungry!! But she usually goes after the scent of money so she may consider suing her lawyer for negligent advice, May be she can recover some of her costs in this matter that way.\nYes, you would think that she and her lawyer would have tested the validity of the evidence before starting legal proceedings. Once again, it demonstrates her solipsistic view of the world.\n\u2026 he\u2019s not the Messiah, he\u2019s a very naughty boy. (!)\nI am Michael Rattner and so is my wife!\nIf \u201cMichael Rattner\u201d manages to see Pauline Hanson buried under a mountain of legal bills, I think we should make him Australian of the Year\u2026 might just be a blank space, but a space to which I would be most grateful.\nYeah, all right, so it\u2019s fake and Hansen loses. She came close to getting a seat, it wasn\u2019t close enough, she thought there was a conspiracy, it vanishes into thin air, case closed.\nUnder the circumstances, it would not have been beyond the bounds of plausibility for some temp vote-counter to imagine they were doing the state a service by perverting the electoral process.\nAfter all, stranger things have happened. Specifically, stranger things have happened to Pauline Hanson herself. I\u2019m talking of the way she was previously fitted up and imprisoned in a flagrantly political prosecution on electoral technicalities. I\u2019m also talking of the time and energy the media and the public invested in character assassinating her \u2014 instead of discrediting her bone-headed ideas.\nTo date, much of what she espouses remains un-debated in Australian society, an unquiet ghost not put to rest, because lampooning, character assassination, and trumped up criminal charges, are so much easier and \u2014 let\u2019s face it \u2014 so much more fun for journalists. That\u2019s why she almost got a seat in the Legislative Council.\nBuckingham, you won, congratulations, now get over it and move on. The democratic electoral process from time to time has to have its integrity tested and confirmed. It\u2019s inconvenient for those involved but it is necessary to avoid lingering doubts. Be satisfied with your victory, and move on.\ncant stop laughing\nAlso, I\u2019m a bit mystified why Buckingham and Johnson required representation by a silk. Surely it was a NSW Electoral Commission matter, and you could have just left the Commission to sort out the challenge to its own integrity. If you felt you had to have a silk \u2014 perhaps to assist the Commission in its inquiries, to discredit the credibility of witnesses, or to manage the media side of things \u2014 then it seems to me that was your choice, not something that Hanson or anybody else forced you to do, or should have to pay for.\nShe\u2019ll appeal. Pauline has never been a fan of long sentences.\nCare to remind us who was responsible for fitting Hanson up, Free Country?\nI admire your trust in Public Sector agencies to investigate themselves and sort things out \u2026 not necessarily wise though.\nHanson initiated legal proceedings, so everyone tools up with a silk. Nature of the beast.\nBy technicalities (those by which Pauline was fitted up) I assume you\u2019re talking about the electoral laws. Which bits would you like to ignore?\nThere is no point debating Hanson\u2019s ideas - they are not ideas, they are feelings. It gives them too much weight to debate them alongside serious informed opinions (which are open to change and persuasion . Nothing would or could change her attitudes or the feelings of her disciples \u2026 only history. And it is doing it in trumps.\nBut her poison lives on in DIAC and its attitudes to asylum seekers. They are living in her shadow.\nThis isn\u2019t the end of a conspiracy, this is a revelation of an even bigger one: Obviously \u201cthey\u201d got to Mr. Rattner and erased his existence before he could reveal the truth!\nI have to run now, I think I hear black helicopters coming\u2026\nSorry Andrew cannot be, my bookies pet hampster is Michael Rattner, well according to the little green man who arrived by flying object 2 nights ago in a saucer shaped craft, he insists the hampster is the reincarnation of his long lost brother Fred Smith from..oh damn he\u2019s gone.\nOh dear Pauline.\nSomebody teach Pauline how to spot a troll, for crying out loud.\nThis guy should get IRL troll of the year.\nWhy? What do you think I\u2019ve got to do with any of them, including the well known politician who set up the fund in support of the action? If you\u2019ve got something to say, Holden Back, say it. And while you\u2019re at it, tell me you were not among those raining down meaningless innuendos against Hanson\u2019s character during her heyday instead of discrediting her ideas? Tell me you weren\u2019t one of those who cheered that democracy was well served by that frame-up?\nDon\u2019t even joke about it. Somewhere in Qld as we speak a counter movement calling themselves \u201cRattners\u201d are mobilising to defend the free world (& their guns). Apparently someone saw a \u201csmoking man\u201d near Michael Rattner\u2019s last known wherabouts. The truth is out there\u2026..\nOh, go on, Free Country, you can say Tony Abbott! We both know he pursued her like a rat up a drain pipe. Not something he mentions much these days. Whether you have anything to do with him or feel any shame is your business.\nI was not among those you seem to condemn for shallowness in their condemnation of Hanson. I was one who thought at the time, the less said about her character the better, and that Abbott\u2019s pursuit of her was ill-judged. Her alleged \u2018ideas\u2019 spoke volumes about her fitness for governing, and she needed less, not more, exposure in my view.\nBut I\u2019d love to hear a defence of the one percent flat taxation rate scheme. Aaah, happy days!\nstill laughing\nAnyone seen my Godwin Grech doll?\nAnd I\u2019m Michael Rattner.\nI\u2019ll second that nomination of Michael Rattner, blank space or not, for Australian of the Year. Hell, why not nominate him for a Nobel Peace Prize as well.\nDoesn\u2019t the poor grammar in the email give it away? Would the NSW Electoral Commission\u2019s chief information officer write: \u201cone of her scrutineers was meant to of found some of her votes in among the blanks\u201d? I hope not. Hanson and her advisers obviously didn\u2019t notice \u2013 but then they \u201cwouldn\u2019t of\u201d \u2026\nWot\u2019s that got to do wif anyfink. She read it somewhere, so someone said it so it\u2019s true see. Now where\u2019s my silk.\nMs Hanson (and her dwindling minions) will always believe what she wants to believe. Facts, evidence, reasonable argument \u2026. please explain.\nThe planets have not been in ideal alignment for Pauline Hanson in recent years. Her strength appears to be persistence but I doubt that relentlessly pursuing a political career will bring her any happiness.\nI agree with Jim Reiher: surely any competent lawyer would have advised their client that a witness\u2019 testimony should be tested before filing a writ, let alone going to trail. Typically one would take an affidavit before filing and present the witness to the hearing to elaborate and be cross examined on their affidavit and evidence in chief.\nI therefore infer that Hanson was offered this advice but declined to follow it. In such circumstances I would set out my advice and get my client\u2019s explicit instructions in writing.\nThe long-suffering taxpayer continues to pay for Hanson to learn how the legislature and judiciary work. A very expensive education.\nWhy would a supposedly Labor voter named Rattner has been calling Leo Shanahan a journalist from \u2018The Australian\u2019 ?\nSure, it all must be an evil Labor conspiracy right? Coming from the Oz journalist I will add a bottle of salt to it.\nWhen Pauline walked out of chokey she said she was going to mount a campaign to highlight the terrible circumstances in which female prisoners in Australia lived.\nStill waiting.\nApollo I understand Leo Shanahan is the off spring of the not so revered Shanahan Snr the doyen of all that is cr-p in journalism. Your salt application is well advised.\nPerhaps a doppelganger whistle blower is lurking?\nthere is real\nBwahahahahaha!!!!! You turn up to court without even meeting your chief witness and the only source of support for your case?????? She\u2019s even thicker than I thought\u2026\nHow about adapting that scene from the film Spartacus - one after the other the gladiators shout \u201cI\u2019m Michael Rattner!\u201d\nPS - I\u2019m Michael Rattner, and so are my two dogs\u2026\nRattner\u2026 sounds sort of \u201cforeign\u201d doesn\u2019t it?\nThanks. I wonder if he is employed thanks to nepotism or because he writes equally cr-p as his senior. I don\u2019t really read the Oz anymore. The last time I read it was only out of curiosity, reading an article by Janet Albrechtsen critiquing Julia Gillard\u2019s barrenness; I almost throw up.\nI agree with Matt Holden: \u201cone of her scrutineers was meant to of found some\u201d. Year 7 English FAIL!\nI am surprised Ian Brightwell didn\u2019t go on to say \u201cI reckon youse all better keep yer traps shut about this or we is all gonna be toast, right?\u201d\nThe downside of all this is if Pauline has to pay costs, then we can no doubt expect to see PH running again (for the money of course).\nI wish the trash-bag would just p*ss off back to the UK.\nRattner - sounds like rat on her?\nI wonder if this \u201cRattner\u201d person is one of those \u201cmuslin\u201d people Pauline is so antsy about?\nFC (& Holden) : Ha!

Keep pining, me old fiord.\nThat awkward moment when your constant whingeing is found to have been based on a grotesque lie.\nGo away Pauline, we\u2019ve had enough of you.\nThat is all.\n@6.26 Gusface\nJust a little advice so you can contain your rage about being moderated: whenever a link is included in a post it is held for moderation. This happens to all posters not just you. Sometimes moderation can take several hours or, on a long weekend, perhaps a couple days.\nNo need to get your knickers in a knot about it.\nHolden Back,\nExcuse my French but WTF are you talking about, you jumped up little git? Why would the question arise of me feeling any shame for something I\u2019ve just brought attention to?\nIt was monkeys like you, all across the political spectrum, who crowed the loudest about Hanson being sent to prison on trumped up charges of electoral technicalities, as if the conviction had been some great triumph of democracy. Not only the act of framing a politician to silence her, but even more importantly, the public rejoicing at her conviction and sentencing, left a lot of fringe voters with the impression that she was speaking an inconvenient truth. You gave legitimacy to a political idea which had none to start with, you gibbering baboons, and every indication is that if you had the chance you\u2019d do it all again.\nThat\u2019s why she almost won a seat on the NSW Legislative Council, which would have degraded Australia\u2019s oldest Upper House even more than it\u2019s been degraded already in recent years. That\u2019s also why, when cause for suspicion arose that someone might have perverted the electoral process, it wasn\u2019t too hard to believe that it might be true. If any other politician had made such a claim, it would barely even have made the papers. But the fact that the alleged victim was Pauline Hanson actually made the allegation halfway plausible.\nIt was therefore perfectly proper for the matter to be taken seriously and investigated in full. Not only Pauline Hanson, but also her Greens opponent Jeremy Buckingham, appears to have been taken in by the hoax.\n(( news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/mp-calls-in-authorities-over-dupe-fears-20110609-1fuef.html ))\nAnd the NSW Electoral Commission confirms that there were in fact some ballot papers wrongly counted as blanks in one booth, which had in fact been valid votes for Pauline Hanson. This doesn\u2019t help Hanson \u2014 the number was only about a dozen votes, not 1200 as the elusive \u201cMichael Rattner\u201d was supposed to have claimed \u2014 but it\u2019s still a cautionary tale. Either an honest isolated mistake, or some vote-counter temping for the NSWEC really did think it that it was his/her public duty to pervert the electoral process and defraud the people of NSW.\nThere\u2019s nothing in the saga of Pauline Hanson for anyone to feel proud of. Not the misguided dupes who voted for her; not the abusers of public trust who have made it their personal mission to bring her down; and especially not the rabble of journalists, disk jockeys, and members of the public, who have felt the need to prove their fair-mindedness by laughing far too loudly at every personal blow struck against her.\nNot sure how Freecountry can conclude that \u201cmuch of what [Hanson] espouses remains un-debated in Australian society\u201d.\nHer main contention was that Australia is being \u201cflooded\u201d by strange and dangerous foreigners, which is not only a perennial topic of public discussion in Australia, but is almost the raison d\u2019etre of the Murdoch press - second only these days to the War on Science.\nWhat else did she have to say? That aboriginals should go and die quietly in the desert and stop being a burden on the white taxpayer? We had that debate last century.\nEverything else that came out of her mouth was the standard country politician tripe about farmers being the heart, soul and only worthy inhabitants of the nation, plus a grab-bag of conspiracy theories, misguided protectionist ideas, and sincere claims that Australia\u2019s most virulent racists represent the moral majority and are sick of being sidelined.\nReally, if we need to discuss all of that again, Bob Katter\u2019s new party is a gift from the gods.\nI am Michael Rottnest and so are my quokkas!!!\nFreeCountry, is it possible to make your posts less verbose? It would take about 1/3 of the text to sum up what you are saying.\nAll that without a shred of evidence. Truly amazing.\nEvidence? Evidence? Please explain.\nWhy are you pretending not to be Michael Rattner?", "label": 1}

But in rare cases, fungal infections can spread below the skin\u2019s surface and onto the lymph nodes, bones, digestive tract, or even the brain.\nResearchers at Rockefeller University in New York City and at Necker Medical School in Paris have discovered a genetic deficiency that allows fungi to spread in this way \u2014 a condition called deep dermatophytosis. Their work suggests why treatments for fungal infections sometimes fail, and it gives weight to a genetic theory of infectious diseases, which proposes that a single genetic defect can cause an otherwise healthy person to become severely ill from a minor infection \u2014 be it viral, bacterial, or fungal.\nThe researchers examined the genomes of 17 people who had deep dermatophytosis but were otherwise healthy \u2014 their immune systems were working well and should have been able to fight off the infection. The researchers focused on a particular gene, CARD9, because previous studies of other fungal infections had found a defect on this gene to be the cause. After sequencing the patients\u2019 genomes, CARD9 was indeed found to be deficient in all of them.\nThe research, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, is the latest evidence that genetics play an important role in an individual\u2019s ability to overcome infectious diseases.\n\u201cAs we discover more of these single-gene, inborn immune-system defects, we can give susceptible individuals with a family history of the disease a chance to prevent it, through molecular diagnosis and genetic counseling, as well as targeted treatments that restore a poor immune response,\u201d said lead investigator Dr. Jean-Laurent Casanova.\nSource: Rockefeller University; October 21", "label": 1}
{"text": "Pfizer's second-quarter net income more than quadrupled, helped by the sale of its animal health business and a gain from settling litigation.\nThe world's second-largest drugmaker beat Wall Street's earnings expectations, though revenue continued to decline due to expired patents on former blockbuster drugs that once brought Pfizer sales of well over $1 billion a year.\nMeanwhile, just a day after Pfizer announced it will reorganize into three businesses starting in January, analysts peppered company executives on a conference call with questions about how soon it could split up into multiple companies. Pfizer said that would take at least three years, but it hasn't decided to do so.\nThe company noted unfavorable exchange rates cut revenue by 3 percent. Worse yet, Pfizer said growth is slowing in emerging markets such as China and India.\nThe company now expects that revenue to climb in 2013 by only a mid-single-digit percentage, down from prior forecasts of high-single-digits. That's worrying because the pharmaceutical industry has pinned most hopes for future growth on those countries, as western governments continue to try to rein in prices.\n\"The emerging markets did not grow as fast as we expected,\" Pfizer CEO Ian Read told The Associated Press in an interview. \"This is in part due to some slowing up of purchases and some pricing pressure\" by governments in emerging markets.\nStill, the biggest problem was a continuing revenue decline due generic competition. The worst hit has been on cholesterol fighter Lipitor, which was the world's best-selling drug for nearly a decade until it lost exclusivity in the U.S. late in 2011 and in much of Europe last year. Revenue from Lipitor, which once brought in nearly $13 billion a year, dropped 55 percent to $484 million in the second quarter. Meanwhile, generic rivals also hurt sales of Alzheimer's symptom treatment Aricept and Spiriva, an inhaler for respiratory conditions.\nWhen drug patents expire, generic versions flood the market and their prices eventually drop up to 90 percent. Most patients quickly switch to them.\nRead told the AP that from now through 2016, Pfizer each year faces patent expirations for drugs with annual sales totaling $3.5 billion to $4 billion.\nMany analysts have \"Buy\" recommendations for Pfizer, though, because of promising new and experimental drugs.\nPfizer, which makes Viagra and the pain medicines Lyrica and Celebrex, earned $14.1 billion, or $1.98 per share. That compares with $3.25 billion, or 43 cents per share, a year earlier.\nPfizer, long under pressure to boost what shareholders get from its dividends and share price appreciation, has been working to sell off non-core businesses and focus on prescription medicines, particularly for disorders lacking good treatments.\nThe company's second-quarter profit jumped mainly on the spin-off of its animal drug business, completed in late June when it divested its remaining 80 percent stake in the new company, called Zoetis Inc. That gave Pfizer an after-tax gain of $10.6 billion, bringing its total take from the spinoff to $17.2 billion.\nNew York-based Pfizer also received $1.4 billion from a patent settlement with two companies that sold generic versions of popular heartburn treatment Protonix while they were challenging its patent, which hadn't yet expired.\nExcluding those gains, earnings were 56 cents per share, a penny better than expected.\nThe company said overall revenue fell 7 percent to $12.97 billion, just short of the $13.21 billion analysts polled by FactSet had predicted.\nIn midday trading, shares were up 23 cents at $29.77.\nPfizer has already divested its nutrition and capsule-making businesses and on Monday announced a reorganization into three divisions.\nOne will be devoted to products that have lost patent protection, or will through 2015. Those include Viagra, Celebrex, Lyrica and antibiotic Zyvox \u2014 but only in some countries. Another division will handle drugs with years of patent protection remaining. The third that will sell vaccines, cancer medicines and consumer products such as Centrum vitamins.\nLeerink Swan analyst Seamus Fernandez said the restructuring \"offers greater flexibility to continue the current shareholder friendly strategy of further focusing the business on its core operating businesses.\"\nPfizer also announced plans to repurchase $10 billion in company shares, on top of $3.1 billion remaining under its previous buyback grew 10 percent to $1.13 billion, and anti-inflammatory pain reliever Celebrex rose 8 percent to $715 million.\nSales of impotence drug Viagra were nearly flat at $484 million despite a precedent-setting move in May to start selling it online to counteract massive counterfeiting on the Internet.\nLinda A.

{"text": "Posted: 05/11/2012\nIt is mosquito season again.\nWith concerns about West Nile Virus, many of us are afraid to use our back decks anymore.\nSure, you can cover yourself from head to toe with bug spray, but what if you want to get mosquitoes out of your yard, for good?\nWants to Take His Yard Back\nButch Reed has a yard full of mosquitoes at his home, and like a lot of homeowners, wants to take his yard back.\n\"You can see the woods back there, particularly in the wooded area; you get a lot of mosquitoes. And we just want to be able to enjoy our yard,\" Reed said.\nSo he decided to fight back. He ordered a $29 insect trap he saw advertised online called \"My Mosquito Deleter.\"\nThe box states,\" The eggs go in and they don't come out.\"\n\"When they lay their eggs the eggs are supposed to fall down into the bottom,\" he said. \"And they can't get out because of the design of the baffles.\"\nSpray Products Popular\nWhile we were waiting to see the results of the mosquito trap, we stopped at ACE hardware, which sells dozens of mosquito products from bug spray and citronella candles to smoking coils you place outside.\nACE manager John Doucleff said any spray you cover yourself with that contains DEET is effective. Concerned about the safety of DEET? Try out Avon's Skin so Soft, sold by Avon distributors, that many people swear by.\nBut Doucleff said he prefers backyard sprays -- such as those from Off and Cutter -- that you use a few hours before a cookout.\nHe also suggested a simple solution for patios: Set up a fan, because mosquitoes don't like wind.\n\"If you notice,\" Doucleff said. \"On a windy day you don't get bit as much.\"\nMore wind means fewer mosquitoes.\nMore Permanent Solutions\nBut what if you want to get rid of mosquitoes permanently, not just for a few hours?\nWe went to one of the country's top bug experts, entomologist Dr. Gene Kritsky.\nKritsky -- who enjoyed international fame a few years ago as a top Cicada expert -- said the most important thing is to eliminate stagnant water.\n\"If you have a big heavy rainstorm followed by a heat wave, where the lows don't get below 71 for a week, you will get thousands of new mosquitoes from that event,\u201d said Kristky.\nCheck Flower Pots, Gutters\nYou might say, \"I don't have any standing water in my yard, I don't have a pond nearby.\"\nBut look more closely. You might have a flower pot, and that's a perfect breeding ground.\"\n\"Check your gutters, check flower pots, and if you have a bird bath, empty it once, a week and put new water in,\" Kritsky said.\nTop Rated Traps\nBut if eliminating water still leaves your yard buggy, Consumer Reports Magazine suggests a mosquito trap.\nA top rated trap is the Mosquito Magnet that lures the bugs with carbon dioxide generated by a propane tank. It costs between $300 and $700, depending on model.\nOthers that generate carbon dioxide also work, the magazine said.\nOn a budget? The magazine said cheaper traps that don't generate gas can have some effectiveness, which brings us back to Butch Reed.\nAfter just a week, he found some mosquito larvae in his $29 Mosquito Deleter, indicating mosquitoes had laid their eggs in it.\n\"It seems to be working,\" he said.\nReed hasn't yet won the war, but Reed said the Mosquito Deleter seems to be an effective start, by capturing their eggs before they hatch. (Consumer Reports magazine has not tested it, however.)\nThe Bottom Line\nKritsky said citronella candles and other smoking devices only work in very small areas, such as on a patio table.\nFor a yard full of bugs, he suggests, do the following 3 things:\n1. Dry out all water, including gutters and flower pots.\n2. Use an area spray, such as those from Cutter and Off. The versions you mount on a garden hose cover more area than aerosol cans.\n3. As a last resort, purchase a trap. More expensive units that generate carbon dioxide do the best job, according to Consumer Reports.\nCopyright 2012 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

{"text": "Attracting free targeted traffic is one of the key factors that all successful websites have in common. Since there are so many advice about traffic growth and the avoidance of Google penalties out there, I\u2019m going to present my 4 favorite traffic strategies to you. Please be aware that non of those strategies is a failsafe way to increase to traffic. But used in combination you\u2019re on a pretty good way to build a consistent stream of visitors.\nThose strategies can be used by anyone and they\u2019re used by thousands of website owners all over the world. I recommend implementing those strategies one at a time, so that you can really focus on the specific aspects. I\u2019m not saying that you should use only one of those methods \u2013 if you can, use them all! But only start with one at a time to stay focused.\nBut before you start implementing any of these strategies I want you to visit Quicksprout and check the current SEO status of your website for free. Quicksprout is a blog run by Neil Patel, who optimized websites for Amazon, Microsoft, Techcrunch or General Motors. So there\u2019s definitely value in using his free report to analyze your website.\nOn-Site SEO Optimization\nThis optimization techniques should be used on any website. It\u2019s probably the most basic optimization technique and the most controversial technique at the same time. I\u2019m talking about keyword research and optimizing your content so that it can rank for the targeted keywords.\nYou\u2019re using keyword research tools like Long Tail Pro to find keywords that are relevant for your business. I\u2019ll write another post about developing a keyword strategy, it would be too in-depth for this post.\nI used keyword research to get started with MyGreatOnlineBusiness and I\u2019m still relying on it when I\u2019m generating new content. One of the most popular ambassadors of this technique is Neil Patel, Mr. Traffic himself. He\u2019s probably the most popular SEO expert and has optimized websites for some the most popular brands.\nHaters say that this technique is slowly dying, since content should always be generated for your audience and not for search engines \u2013 and I agree 100% with the latter part of that statement!\nContent that\u2019s hard to read because it includes keywords in grammatically wrong context will only harm your site. But if you find a way to include relevant keywords in your articles and those keywords have low competition, you\u2019ll attract free traffic from Google to your site.\nBut what does optimized content look like? When you\u2019re using WordPress as your platform, I recommend that you use the free YoaST plugin for search engine optimization. This plugin makes it easy to follow along with the site elements I\u2019m going through next that can be optimized.\nThe most important piece of content in terms of SEO is your title tag. This is the title in your site\u2019s snippet the search results page and the title that\u2019s shown in the tab of your browser. It\u2019s not necessarily the title of your post.\nYou\u2019ll definitely want to include your keyword in your title and give the person seeing the search results page an irresistible reason to click on your title, and not on the result above or below your snippet. The title length should not exceed 70 characters, otherwise Google just cuts it off.\nAnother part of the snippet on the search results page is your meta description. The meta description is for your user, not for the search engine. As Neil Patel states, it has NO direct effect on the ranking \u2013 BUT it\u2019s your chance to convince the user to click on your site instead of clicking on any other site.\nSo it\u2019s a good idea to include something unique like your unique selling proposition, unique value proposition or any other unique specifications in there. Anything longer than 150 characters gets cut off.\nXML sitemaps or HTML sitemaps can be used to ensure that websites have indexed all of your posts and pages. You can generate them automatically using the YoaST plugin I recommended above and submit them to Google Webmastertools and Bing Webmastertools.\nThe submit encourages the crawlers of Bing and Google to visit your site again and to check whether there\u2019s new content or whether the existing content has changed.\nImages and Outbound Links\nImages are very important when it comes to ranking, since Google assumes that images add value for the user. They come with an alternative tag, the so-called ALT tag. Do yourself a favor and always add information in the ALT tag, since Google can\u2019t recognize what\u2019s on the specific image.\nAdd relevant keywords that describe what\u2019s shown on the image, so that Google knows the image is relevant for your content.\nAnother benefit of using the ALT tag is that screen-readers can use it when they go through your text. Especially blind people (yes, they are using the Internet) rely heavily on screen-readers and you\u2019re doing them a disfavor when you\u2019re leaving ALT tags or image titles empty.\nOutbound links are those links that go from your site to another site. Those are important because they provide value to your visitor (assuming you\u2019re linking to relevant sites) and they show Google that you\u2019re not in your own little universe but pay attention to other sites as well.\nAgain, the YoaST plugin will help you to keep track of the outbound links in your post. Another awesome tool to use is Zemanta, which is a handy WordPress plugin that suggests articles to link to and images to use in your post.\nPage Load Speed\nThe speed of your website is important. At the moment this is a problem on my site as the average load time is 2 seconds. I\u2019ll need to find ways to get that under a second and I\u2019m already working on the solution.\nGoogle loves fast websites and that\u2019s why you should optimize your site for loading speed. You can test your website for free and then decide what things you can do to make it faster.\nSome plugins I love are Use Google Libraries, WP Super Cache and WP Smush.It. Those are a pretty good setup to start with, tweaking your images, caching your files and reducing the amount of scripts loaded.\nIt\u2019s also important that your theme is coded to load fast. That means no unnecessary scripts should be loaded in the header, so that the content is loaded as fast as possible. Also it should be coded in valid HTML 5 and compatible with minifying functions, which extract whitespaces and line-breaks out of the files to reduce their file size.\nThis is a short insight on how you can do on-site SEO optimization. Obviously there is a TON of more opportunities to improve your site, shoot me an email if you\u2019d like to have me analyze your site.\nBacklink Building\nBacklink building is a part of off-site optimization, the counterpart to on-site optimization. Backlinks are a sign for Google that people value your site and that they like your content.\nAssuming that you didn\u2019t purchase backlinks, people link to your site because they appreciate your content and find it worth sharing. That\u2019s why backlinks have such a massive impact on your ranking and that\u2019s why so many scammers offer backlinks packages that you shouldn\u2019t purchase, since they\u2019d only harm your site.\nHere are four different methods how you can earn backlinks in an ethical way that will increase your rankings and drive traffic to your website.\nBlog Commenting\nProbably the most popular method to earn backlinks is commenting on other blogs that are relevant in your niche. This means that you\u2019re visiting other blogs and leave a comment on the posts.\nMy good friend Navid Moazzez has built his reputation with extensive commenting on other blogs and now he\u2019s building relationships with Internet entrepreneurs like Natalie Sisson from SuitCase Entrepreneur, John Lee Dumas from Entrepreneur on Fire and more equally famous people.\nThis method is very time consuming, since you need to find something valuable to say in your comment. If you can\u2019t add any value to the discussion, don\u2019t leave a comment at all!\nBut this method definitely has more benefits than earning backlinks to your site. Most blogs allow no-follow backlinks in their comments section anyway, so you\u2019ll won\u2019t get any link juice from those links.\nThough what you do get is credibility and traffic from the readers of the comments. The host of the blog will notice when you\u2019re constantly engaging by leaving valuable comments. It\u2019s a sign of respecting the efforts and valuing the work from the blog host.\nAlso the other commenters will notice that you\u2019re constantly leaving relevant contents and sharing your expertise with others. So some of them will visit your blog and consume your posts as well.\nSo you\u2019re not only building relationships with the blog host but also with the readers of the other blogs. It\u2019s not about competing with other bloggers but about engaging with a part of their audience and adding value to their sites.\nMake sure that you add relevant information with every comment you\u2019re leaving! Otherwise you\u2019ll quickly be known as a spammer.\nGuest Posting\nGuest posting is another popular method to build relationships and earn backlinks. Successful entrepreneurs like Henri Juntilla from and Brendan Baker from used guest blogging to build credibility and now they\u2019re running highly successful Internet businesses.\nSince they\u2019re friends of mine and agreed to provide some content for this post, I will let them speak instead of myself. I have only little experience with guest posting and I want to online provide information that are verified by real business successes.\nGuest posting Strategy by Henri Juntilla\nThe name of Henri\u2019s business is Wakeupcloud and he used guest blogging extensively in the first days to grow as fast and sustainable as possible. During hours and hours of writing guest posts and approaching countless blogs he found some common principles that you can use as guidance to maximize your success with guest blogging.\nThere\u2019s no need to be turned down by blog hosts who don\u2019t want to publish your guest posts. In fact, if you\u2019re following Henri\u2019s very detailed guest posting guide you\u2019ll recieve all information you\u2019ll ever need to get started with guest blogging or to take it to another level.\nAnother very interesting case study is how Henri grew Wakeupcloud from 0 to 1.012 blog subscribers within 101 days. This shows the power of guest posting \u2013 you can see how much credibility he build up in his target market.\nWe\u2019ve all heard that the money is in the list, and guest posting definitely paid off for Henri!\nGuest Posting Strategy by Brendan Baker\nBrendan is a friend of mine and the host I asked him via email whether he has a specific strategy for guest posting and this is his awesome response:\nAlthough I\u2019m not currently too active in the guest posting arena (mainly due to time commitments), it has certainly helped to generate quality email subscribers at a faster rate.\nMy strategy for guest posting is pretty simple. Target the biggest blogs I can, write quality content and send it through for review\nEven when the site owner asks to send an email to discuss a potential topic idea, I would simply write the full article, submit it with my bio and picture and let them decide. I figure that this saves time for the person reviewing as we don\u2019t have to send emails back and forth, they can simple come back with a \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019.Usually when I get a no it comes with some good feedback. I would then either make some edits based on the feedback or (if it\u2019s a hard \u2018no\u2019) simply use the content for another pitch elsewhere or use it for my site. In saying that, if you have an idea that is a bit left-field or you\u2019re unsure whether the content could be used elsewhere, I would recommend checking with the website owner.\nThe key to guest posting is to make sure that the content is relevant for the target audience where you\u2019re pitching. It\u2019s useful to browse through previous posts on the blog and get an idea. Even better, take a look at the \u2018top posts\u2019 or \u2018popular posts\u2019 to see what kind of content works best.\nWhen it comes to linking, think about the keywords and pages you want to target. If the site your pitching to allows links in the content area then make full use of it and get one in back to your website. Your bio is critically important to get click-throughs. Test your bios out for conversion. What kind of text works best? Also think about what text anchors you use when linking to help with your SEO.\nA hugely important part of guest posting is to read the contributor guidelines if they have any. It may seem simple, but there are so many website owners (including myself) who receive submissions that do not conform to the guidelines. It\u2019s an instant no-go as it shows the guest poster is a) careless, b) can\u2019t read and c) doesn\u2019t really care for quality.\nOther than that, quantity is the name of the game when guest posting. If you can produce a huge amount of guest posts you\u2019ll be sure on your way to some good traffic (assuming they\u2019re quality too\u2026 but I don\u2019t need to tell you that\nThose two examples show the power that lies within guest posting, especially when you\u2019re starting out or haven\u2019t submitted any guest post before.\nDon\u2019t be intimidated by other blogs and the size of their audience. If you follow the principles outlined in Henri\u2019s and Brendan\u2019s advice, you\u2019re set up for success! As always, the key is to get started and to continually work hard to submit only high quality posts. There\u2019s enough noise out there, so don\u2019t become a part of that.\nI think that Henri and Brendan did a terrific job in explaining their guest posting strategies. Thank you guys for your efforts!\nDirectory Submissions\nThere has been a huge discussion about directory submissions, but still they do work and can help to rank your website if you consider the following advice:\n- Submit to high quality directories\n- Submit to directories relevant for your niche\n- Avoid directories that accept every link\nLet\u2019s say that you\u2019re in the marketing niche and you\u2019re searching for directories to submit your site to. You can use this Google search to find directories easily:\nallintitle:marketing directory\nThis gives you sites with titles containing \u201cmarketing\u201d and \u201cdirectory\u201d. You can also utilize other advanced search operators for this (and other) searches.\nThe Shout-Out Strategy\nThe Shout-Out Strategy was originally created by David Siteman Garland from The Rise To The Top.\nBasically you\u2019re creating posts where you give shout outs to popular people in your niche. Share information about them, for example explain to your readers why those people are providing so valuable content that everyone should know them.\nDavid describes those posts as follows:\nA specific post that gives love to key people in your niche.\nAwesome traffic builder & excuse to reach out to them (and if you want to do interviews great way to build relationships).\nCan be a huge opt in beast.\nSo you\u2019re recieving several benefits by following the Shout Out Strategy. So what are the reasons why this strategy works so well?\nPeople love recognition. \u2013 David Siteman Garland\nEverybody loves to be mentioned in a positive context together with other great influencers. No matter how big you are, you\u2019re humbled when somebody says good things about you and compares you to other popular people in your field.\nSo what you need to do to create a successful shout out post is to find an angle that\u2019s interesting for your target market. People see the title at first, so you need to make it interesting enough for people to read the whole post.\nFor example my good friend Navid Moazzez wrote a post about 35 Lifestyle Entrepreneurs You Need To Know. This post got 54 comments at the moment I\u2019m writing this and allowed him to build relationships with some of the people mentioned \u2013 like Natalie Sisson from\nFind a list of at least 10 key people in your field and aggregate them into a list. What makes every single one of them unique? What part of their work is worth being mentioned? How can others benefit from paying attention to them?\nThose are the basic principles to write a shout out post, if you want more, head over to David\u2019s original video.\nYou may wonder how you get in touch with the people on your list. It\u2019s as easy as sending them an email or tweeting them and thanking them for the great work they\u2019re doing. Don\u2019t ask for anything, just thank them and include a link to your post in your message.\nIf they respond you\u2019ve successfully established a conversation that may lead to a deeper relationship over time. And having a network with the key people in your niche can\u2019t be valued high enough.\nThanks David for coming up with this awesome traffic building strategy!\nWrite Epic Shit\nThis strategy is originally coming from Corbett Barr, co-host of ThinkTraffic and Fizzle. He has built several blogs and earned six figures after 18 months with his first two blogs (one of them is ThinkTraffic).\nWrite epic shit is totally independent from any kind of optimization technique mentioned above. The goal is to write epic content that get\u2019s so much organic attention that people find it naturally via social shares, word of mouth or any other method that can be used to forward a URL to a post.\nWhile Corbett writes detailed advice about how to write epic shit, I\u2019m outlining some of the most important aspects of this strategy.\nIn every conversation I\u2019ve had with wildly successful entrepreneurs and bloggers about building website traffic, promotional tactics only make up 20% of our talks.\nSo, what is the other 80% of building a popular site about?\nBuilding a raving audience online all starts with writing epic shit. Period. Hands down. End of story.\n(If you aren\u2019t building a blog, substitute the word \u201ccreate\u201d for \u201cwrite.\u201d Create epic shit. Either way, the formula is the same.)\nWrite things that make people think. Inspire people. Change lives. Create value. Blow people away with your usefulness.\n- Corbett Barr\nThis is right to the key of writing epic shit. It doesn\u2019t have to mean that you\u2019re publishing those crazy long articles as you\u2019re reading right now.\nIn fact, one of Pat Flynn\u2019s most successful posts has only 100 words. Ok, I\u2019m violating this heavily with this post, but you get the principle.\nPat\u2019s post get\u2019s people into thinking what step they need to make next. It kicks people out of procrastination mode \u2013 that\u2019s why it\u2019s epic.\nI\u2019ll be updating this post as I learn new strategies to attract traffic, that\u2019s why this post has a light flavor of being epic to me. But that\u2019s just for me, after all it\u2019s you deciding whether a post is epic or not. (If you think it\u2019s epic, please leave a comment and tell me about your opinion ).\nIs one post by Pat Flynn the prove that epic content works? No.\nBut entrepreneurs like Gary Vaynerchuk, Seth Godin, Clay Collins or Danielle LaPorte are.\nWriting epic shit is definitely worth the efforts, but it\u2019s hard to do when you\u2019re just starting out. So please pay attention to the quote from Corbett Barr mentioned above and stand your ground. Don\u2019t be too shy to ask questions that may shake the universe in your niche. Don\u2019t get quiet when sharing your opinion, especially when it\u2019s conflicting with the general attitude. Be yourself and try your best to improve the lives of others.\nI\u2019m trying to maintain a high standard in my posts, I\u2019m always doing the best I can for every single post. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not publishing at the standard 2 or 3 times a week schedule. It\u2019s just not possible for me to keep the quality if I\u2019d do that.\nAnd I\u2019m not alone with this mindset. Derek Halpern from SocialTriggers is also doing very in-depth research for every single post and thus he\u2019s releasing new posts every two weeks or so. But they are so incredibly high quality that it\u2019s totally sufficient. As I said in the guest posting section, try not to add more noise to the Internet.\nYou can attract traffic on many different ways and especially beginners have no need to be scared of some new vocabulary.\nIn the end it\u2019s not about technique, but about building relationships, writing content for your audience (thus you need to know your audience) and trying your best to provide high quality information every time you post.\nI hope that you\u2019ve found this line up of traffic strategies helpful and I\u2019ll try my best to keep this article up to date when I see a new strategy that\u2019s working well.\nSome of the next things will be social traffic, and I\u2019m excited to dig into that\nKeep up your great work and don\u2019t forget to implement the methods you\u2019re learning!", "label": 1}

{"text": "Civil War era music, at the Music Library\nThe Laurie Music Library, located on the lower level of the Douglass Library, holds a large collection of 19th century sheet music covering most of that century. While there is certainly an aesthetic value attached to the collection, it is the sheet music's historical value that is most significant, since by studying the music and lyrics much can be learned about daily life in various decades of the 1800s. One of the more fascinating parts of this collection is the music from 1860-1865, the Civil War era.\nApril 2011 marked the 150th anniversary of the start of the war, when Confederate forces attacked the Union soldiers stationed at Fort Sumter, South Carolina. In commemoration of this historical event, we present here two songs from our collection.\nThe first song is one of the most popular Confederate songs, \"The Bonnie Blue Flag,\" (listen to the song at the Cylinder Preservation and Digitization Project here) arranged by Harry Macarthy, the Arkansas comedian, and based on a traditional Irish tune, \"The Irish Jaunting Car\" (as performed by Polk Miller and his Old South Quartet.) First published in New Orleans in 1861, the song celebrates the symbol of the Confederacy.\nWhen Northern treachery attempts our rights to mar,\nThe following verses describe the secession of the other southern states, culminating in the final verse\nThen cheer, boys, cheer, raise the joyous shout,\nFor Arkansas and North Carolina now have both gone out;\nAnd let another rousing cheer for Tennessee be given -\nThe Single Star of the Bonnie Blue Flag has grown to be Eleven.\nIn response, a year later, Oliver Dio. of Boston, MA published the song, \"The Bonnie, Red, White, and Blue, or Our Beautiful Flag\" written by J.C.J. to the same tune as \"The Bonnie Blue Flag.\" Its lyrics are a direct response to the Confederate tune, in which the Union replies\nWe never wished to harm you, we'll welcome you again\nWhen you tear down the rebel flag, as brothers and as men.\nWhen Sumter's walls were battered, what could we, freemen, do.\nBut rally round our beautiful flag, of Red White and Blue.\nThe Northern version of the song also encourages the \"southern poor man\" to\nStrike off the captive's chain!\nAnd rally round the starry flag to sing in loud refrain:\nHurrah! Hurrah! for a nation's rights hurrah!\nThese songs, as well as other songs of the era, serve as first-hand accounts of attitudes during the war. A greater understanding of views of the North, South, soldiers, and civilians can be attained by studying the music of this period. You can contact Michelle Oswell, Music/Performing Arts Librarian, at moswell@rulmail.rutgers.edu to arrange to see these and other items from the 19th-century sheet music collection in the Music Library.\nStory written by Sara Rizzo,\nA student in the Masters of Library and Information Science program\nPosted April 18, 2011", "label": 1}

{"text": "It\u2019s Done. And We Heart It.\nIsn\u2019t it strange how\nyou can start a project (in this case the gallery of frames that we wanted to \u201cwallpaper\u201d our hallway walls with) and then just leave the other half of it undone for a month. Not weeks. Literally a month. What\u2019s wrong with us? And it\u2019s not like we weren\u2019t obsessed with the results of the first half of the project (recounted here):\nWe just ran out of frame gas or something, so we switched over to console building and chair painting and closet organizing and ceramic dog gluing and tree trimming and sectional leg spray-painting and all the other odd things that we\u2019ve tackled since our little wall-hole-making spree. It\u2019s so weird. What possesses DIY folks to work in fits and starts like that? Oh well, who cares, we\u2019re back on the frame-hanging bandwagon now. All is right with the world.\nYup, after a month of staring at taped up newspaper templates and a big ol\u2019 stack of frames on the floor we finally mustered up the motivation to hang them up, thereby completing the big hallway o\u2019 frames. Booyah. Here\u2019s the whole shebang:\nIt\u2019s everything we imagined and then some. And it only took a few hours of hammering and hammering and hammering and framing random sentimental objects (and my birthday prints) that I lurve. As for where the frames came from, we already owned around 10 (originally from Ikea and Target on clearance) and we also picked up 14 new ones from Ikea (thanks to a sweet b-day gift card from the fam). Although all of the frames aren\u2019t the exact same shade of white, it\u2019s a soft layered look with some creams and other more crisp white tones that just seem to work even though they don\u2019t match perfectly. We even embraced the whole \u201clayered and different\u201d theme and picked new Ikea frames in varying styles (some more modern and some more decorative or traditional).\nWe already explained the template-making process of creating a frame wall here, but John thought we should throw in a tip about where to put the nail (with pics, because that\u2019s how my brain \u201ceats\u201d info). First John measures down from the top of the frame to see how many inches below the top the nail will actually sit.\nThen he finds the center of the newspaper template and measures down the same amount (4\u2033 in this instance).\nHe marks the template with an x, and then just hammers right into that x and through the template.\nOnce the nail\u2019s in the wall in the right place, he rips the paper template from the wall and slips the frame onto the nail. Bam, a frame in the exact spot that we had the template. Yay math. Or yay rulers. Or more accurately, yay smart hubby.\nOh and you\u2019ll notice that we started with the big frame in the middle of the arrangement (which we intentionally planned for that spot to sort of balance and ground things) so that\u2019s another tip. If you start from the center and work out from there all the frames won\u2019t migrate left or right or up or down as much since you\u2019re starting in the center. And choosing a big frame for the middle should help things feel kind of balanced and well-planned (even if the edges of the smaller frames around it don\u2019t line up and it\u2019s more of an asymmetrical layout from that big frame on).\nHere we have all of the frames hung without any art. Except for that backwards canvas on the left. Yup I hung it with the wood on the back exposed instead of the front canvas side (I taped a pic of J & I into it a while back and liked the raw kind of rustic look). You\u2019ll also notice a few black and white photos that we used to have hanging behind the sofa in our old den in 8 x 10 frames (some of them were now hanging sideways though, so there was still some work to be done on those).\nHere\u2019s another angle, just because I like to pretend I\u2019m fancy with the camera.\nAnd yet another art-less frame POV of the whole hallway:\nOh and when it comes to babyproofing, we do plan to add heavy duty Command velcro to the lower frames that may be within Clara\u2019s reach when she starts toddling around. She\u2019s a pretty docile girl who definitely seems to listen when we ask her to be gentle (when petting her big brother Burger for example) so our plan is to sweetly request that she be nice to the frames and \u201clook with her eyes.\u201d But of course if we think those few low frames ever start to pose a safety hazard (or even just become too high maintenance for the way we live) we\u2019ll definitely just get rid of them until the bean is a little older.\nAnyway, back to the after pics. Here are those frames full of stuff that we already had (from these sweet birthday prints that I got last month to a ton of sentimental keepsakes, photos, and even some pretty non-traditional items that we\u2019ll get to in a minute).\nHere\u2019s a closer look at the little gallery on the left side:\nIt\u2019s full of everything from craft paper with two fortune cookies taped to it (top left) to a black & white wedding pic and even a sweet artsy photo of a water droplet in front of some patterned fabric (top right) that was snapped by my friend Laura.\nThe bottom half of the arrangement has an old craft store peacock feather (I didn\u2019t even put that on paper, the tan color is just the naturally-toned-frame-back showing through the glass), my sweet Etsy bee-day print from John, and even a book cover (remember he also got me a book called Love Life for my b-day? I just took off the paper dust jacket to reveal the pretty cloth cover beneath it, and then decided to repurpose the paper cover as art).\nAnd see that light pink rectangle with Clara\u2019s name on it? That makes me melt. It\u2019s a cute vintage hankie that happened to be embroidered with her moniker. A good friend of ours (thanks Terri!) couldn\u2019t help grabbing it when she realized it was such a coincidence to find something with her name on it. It\u2019s actually really rare to see Clara on anything (they never sell Clara magnets or keychains in stores). I love it so much, and framing it is perfect since the bean doesn\u2019t exactly grasp the whole nose blowing concept yet.\nNow we\u2019ll move over to the little gallery on the right side.\nThe picture below makes me realize that if I\u2019m ever bored I want to move every frame about an inch and a half to the right. Never noticed it \u201cin person\u201d but it seems to hug the doorway on the left a bit more closely. Isn\u2019t it funny how photos make you see things you can\u2019t ever see right in front of you? Anyway, on this side we have our card stock place-holder key that used to be taped up on the other side of the wall, which we have big plans for (someday I want to DIY a white-ceramic-looking key with clay from the craft store). We also framed everything from an old fabric swatch, a quote that I wrote out by hand, more black & white family photos, and even a silhouette of our bald girl.\nHere\u2019s a closer shot of the handwritten quote. I love how soft it looks while other things on the wall jump out. It makes you want to lean in and read it (kind of like how you lean in and pay close attention when someone whispers a secret to you).\nIt\u2019s a quote by Tad Carpenter that I found on Pinterest (where I\u2019ve been living lately, haha) that\u2019s originally from here. I loved the idea of penning something that meaningful in my own chicken scratch handwriting and glorifying it behind glass for all to see (although I spaced it out a bit differently \u2013 in 7 lines instead of 8 \u2013 to better fit my frame). And yes, that\u2019s a Burger foot (and somebody needs to get his nails cut). He likes to sneaking in photos any way he can. I can\u2019t tell you how many dog-butt-in-the-background shots don\u2019t make the blog.\nOh and here\u2019s the back of the Love Life paper book jacket that I also decided to frame. Waste not, want not, right? Only the tiny spine of the book cover was tossed into the trash since I used \u201call other parts\u201d of it for the frame wall. Haha. It\u2019s a quote by Arthur Rubenstein that says \u201cI have found that if you love life, life will love you right back.\u201d It\u2019s true I think.\nHere\u2019s another quick little making-art-from-something-else adventure. We had these charming little desk calendar pages around for each month of the year (from here) but we always deferred to our day planner and my iPhone instead of using/enjoying them. So I took the one for July and drew a thin red frame around the outside of it with a red Sharpie. Remember when you used to color the edges of paper like that to make straight lines on other pages beneath it in grade school? I did that all the time. When I wasn\u2019t doodling Steven\u2019s name (my elementary crush, oh how I longed to hold his hand with my marker stained fingers).\nThen with a thin red pen I drew a heart around the 7th. Because we were married on July 7th, so it feels like a sweet way to honor that special day with something beautiful that we already had on hand (which was shoved into a drawer instead of being enjoyed).\nAnd here\u2019s a funny story about that fabric in the middle. It was actually used as \u201cwrapping paper\u201d from a friend (she didn\u2019t have conventional stuff around but she had that fabric sample so she made it into a little gift pouch). How chic is she? I liked it so much I put a\nring frame on it.\nOne of the fun things about the frame wall is that it\u2019s visible from the hallway that leads to Clara\u2019s room, the hall bath, the playroom, and the guest room. Makes me smile every time I walk back out towards the kitchen. Even when I\u2019m carrying a bunch of laundry or happened to have just stubbed my toe on something. Seriously, the frame wall is like Prozac to me.\nSo there it is. One project finished. Except we\u2019ve only just begun because I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll end up switching everything out a million times. But that\u2019s kind of the fun of it. I can\u2019t wait for Clara to make me some scribbly art for me to proudly display.\nHave you guys framed anything unusual lately? Do you have special memories stuffed into a box or a drawer that you\u2019re dying to get behind some glass? Did you have an elementary school crush on a boy named Steven? Are you Steven, my long lost love? Haha, just kidding. We\u2019re friends on Facebook now. It\u2019s all very PG and he knows I no longer want to hold his hand.\nIf you enjoyed this post, please leave a comment or subscribe to the feed and get future articles delivered to your feed reader.\nLove it! It looks great! The hankie with Clara\u2019s name on it is adorable :)\nThat looks great!\nI\u2019ve kind of been wanting to attack our hallway with a bunch of frames. So far it just has two large prints and a mirror, but maybe I\u2019ll get bold and do a gallery wall or several!\nI heart it, too! Absolutely awesome!\nTotally agree! Looks fabulous!!\nMuch love,\nFuture Mama\nlove it!\nKind of off topic, but do you guys find that having Clara slows down the home improvement processes, or do you accomplish just as much now as you did pre-baby?\nOoh that\u2019s a good question! I think we generally have a certain pace that works for us (nothing too crazy so we don\u2019t quit blogging/get divorced) and nothing too slow (because we\u2019re really bad at sitting on our hands and being idle) so I\u2019d guess that we go at the same general pace as before (with lulls and sprints in there, which seems to be par for the course when you\u2019re a DIYer) \u2013 except now we have to be more efficient with our time and seize the moment if she\u2019s napping or sleeping for the night. There\u2019s a lot more after 7:30 stuff that goes on until around midnight that we used to start around 6 when John got home from work. But now there\u2019s dinner and family time with Clara so we wait until she\u2019s sleeping to get started.\nGorgeous! Congrats on finishing it\u2026 you\u2019ve inspired me to do something similar :)\nI heart it too!\nhaha prozac frames are the best medicine! =) It looks wonderful!\nJenn @ Peas & Crayons\nIt\u2019s stunning. Love the incorporation of the personal mementos, and I especially adore the Clara kerchief \u2013 what a beautiful, one of a kind item. Are they all the original IKEA mats or did you end up DIY\u2019ing any to custom-fit your framable items?\nLove it! Especially how you\u2019ve managed to use something meaningful in each frame. My favorites have to be the book cover/back that you framed. The colors just pop off the wall and really look stunning!\nLove it. I\u2019m really into framing random things \u2013 I framed my favourite cloth tote in a big ribba frame the other day \u2013 it looks awesome \u2013 keep forgetting to blog about it though\u2026\nThat looks fantastic! Where do you find the time though? This would take me years to do\u2026. :)\nOur advice: take a month-long break in the middle. Haha. Apparently it can help you get your momentum back.\nAnother great idea! I want to copy!\nLooks wonderful! So inspired!\nP.S. There\u2019s a typo when you talk about the second part of the hall wall \u201cif you are board to move everything 1/2 in to the right\u201d. Maybe bored instead. :)\nHaha, thanks! That was a weird one! All fixed.\nYour wall looks absolutely amazing!\nAs for framing up interesting things, my husband was recently in Maine for business and I decided to go along with our dogs in tow. Our younger boy, Leopold (he\u2019s a Weimaraner) LOVED the ocean (we\u2019re from Toronto, Canada), and just couldn\u2019t get enough of the shells. He\u2019d pick one up each morning on our walk and proudly prance around with it in his mouth. It was so cute to watch an 80 pound pup perform so enthusiastically! Anyway, as a memento I brought one of the shells home, and would like to put it in a shadow box with a handwritten note that says \u2018Leo\u2019s shell \u2013 Old Orchard Beach Maine, 2010\u2032.\nYour wall has inspired me to hurry up and get it done! Thanks for all you do!\nNow that I am a proud member of Pinterest I have a TON of quotes and ideas I want to frame. Love the calendar idea with your anniversary. So cute!\nSame! Now I just need a wall large enough for all those awesome quotes and ideas and inspiration I\u2019ve gotten from here and from Pinterest.\nYou don\u2019t need me to say it, but once again it looks awesome! I love that this project keeps growing and growning and\u2026\np.s. I know how you feel about finding *something* with Clara\u2019s name on it. My daughter has a unique name, and I doubt we will ever find something with her name (unless we go visit Scotland, the origin of her name.) ;)\nMy boyfriend and I spent one of our first dates playing Scrabble in a coffee shop until 1 in the morning! Ever since, Scrabble has become a great past time. After our first game, he happened to snap a photo of the board. For his birthday today, I purchased a scrabble board game, hot glued all the pieces on it like our first game and framed it in a shadow box. I also had the score sheet from the game (on the back of a coffee shop receipt) and a drink menu that got framed separately :)\nThat\u2019s so cute!\nThat is a beautiful idea. I love it.\nI really think this is my favorite things you guys have ever done! I just love it!\nLove the completed gallery walls! They look great!\nI just noticed in these pics that you all also have a hodge-podge of flooring (so do we!), so I was wondering if your plans are to just ignore them and decorate around them or to actually change them to be more uniform?\nYou know we love nice cohesive flooring! So we don\u2019t plan to remove any of the varying types of hardwood (from wide plank to skinny plank to parquet) but we do have dreams of refinishing them all to match someday down the line.\nI\u2019m -really- digging your gallery walls! They are so fabulicious, I\u2019m tempted to try something similar in our house once we get past the restoration to the decorating stage. I have collected various items we unearthed during the restoration of our 95 year old house (vintage wallpaper, hand cut iron nails, a stove cover, an empty pack of 1910s cigarettes, etc.) that I want to frame in a shadowbox along with a photo of our house.\nAww, I know exactly what you mean about finding things that say \u201cClara\u201d on them. My daughter\u2019s name is Lena, and I get the same thrill whenever I find something with her name on it. :)\nIt looks amazing! I bet I will see this all over pinterest today :) Does it ever weird you out to see your rooms on there?\nAnother great project, you guys! Love YHL :)\nIt always makes me think \u201cwait a minute, a glitch, it\u2019s somehow showing the blog\u201d and then I realize that other people are pinning those pics and I blush. It\u2019s amazing and kind of crazy at the same time.\nLove it congrats on the finished project. I have been on vacation and just now getting back and getting my YHL fix. You all have been busy, like always.\nLooks amazing! I\u2019d love to do this on the wall of our stairs! :)\nLove the picture gallery\u2026so great!!\nI love it! You are lucky to have so much empty wall space. I only wish!\nLOVE the gallery wall! Love love love it!! I have one in my home too, and I just started hanging (from the middle) and hammering! Yikes. I\u2019m lucky it\u2019s not a total mess b/c I didn\u2019t measure anything!! I wish I had been a wee bit more precise like y\u2019all were. It looks BEAUTIFUL, I\u2019m so pleased for you!!\nAh I have so many things to say!\n1. I stalk Pinterest (still accountless though!) and I saw that Tad Carpenter quote a few weeks ago and frantically googled to find a print! Apparently it\u2019s only in his own house? I love that you made your own though, I may have to snatch that idea :)\n2. Thank you for the comment on the multiple shades of white frames. I\u2019ve been collecting frames whenever I can catch them at a good price and was concerned about the differing shades of white frames/mats. Good to know they all blend nicely!\n3. I jump around projects constantly! I like to say I have design ADHD. Mike likes it better that way, he thinks it keeps us constantly motivated and loving what we\u2019re currently working on :)\n4. Um, I love the way this project turned out!\nThe end!\nit\u2019s actually from the recent tour of his home on design sponge\nit\u2019s a new feature they added, where the featured home residents fill in the blank (what i love most about my home is _____)\nIt\u2019s such a great post/idea. I love it so much.\nWhen I first read the hand written note, before the close up shot, I thought it said \u201cwhat I love most about my homies is who I shake it with.\u201d It made me laugh for a long time so I thought I would share\u2026 :)\nHahahahahahahha, hilarious! Shaking it with people is also very important.\nThat hallway looks amazing!\nlovely!! just lovely!\nThis looks fantastic!\nLooks awesome! Go ahead with your fancy photog skills! :D\nI bought a page from someone\u2019s (a farmer\u2019s?) old desk calendar. It\u2019s our wedding date, but 70 years prior. There\u2019s even some old farming notes on it. :) Framed that.\nLove it!!!!!!! Makes me want to flesh out our mini version of this project\u2026\nAnd I love that you used a book cover =) I know I\u2019m not supposed to, but I judge books by their covers all the time \u2013 The one you have is really unique!\nI\u2019m obsessed with those amazing white owl sculptures in your arrangement! So cool!\nThanks!!! Glad you like them =) I was actually searching around Etsy the other day and was astounded to find an EXACT copy of the one that I bought at a thrift shop!\nAs you can tell they look so much better in white\u2026\nWow! I thought all those frames might look cluttered or overwhelming, but once again you guys nailed it! I love Sherry\u2019s home-made quote sketch\u2013 I do that all the time! No reason spending money on something that will be hung with blue sticky tack (curse you, dorm living!). I love how each bit of wall has it\u2019s own subtle color pallette. So pretty!\nIn conclusion, you guys are awesome and your house is gorgeous!\n- Carlie\nThis is so, so great. I have put off so many projects with the mindset that I can\u2019t afford to do that, yet, most of the objects you put in your frames our reclaimed items from your house \u201cstash\u201d. Brilliant. Thank you for cracking my noggin\u2026.Affordable genius\nWhat is the print right below Clara\u2019s handkerchief? I love the food/drinky prints and this one looks beautiful.\nThat\u2019s actually from an old poster I had in the old house from A while back when I was making art for the kitchen I cut it up (it was a still life) and framed different parts of it (the cup of sugar, the apples, the spoon, etc) so I just reused those 4 x 6 \u201cexcerpts\u201d that I made from the original large poster for the frame wall.\nLove the final results! But are you saving all those coupons Sherry??? (referencing the coupon newspaper you used for the frame placement on the walls).\nAre we going to see you on TLC soon as one of the crazy coupon ladies or what? They\u2019re my fave!\nHaha, I am nowhere near those crazy coupons savers! It\u2019s amazing what they do, but the idea of a stockpile makes me itch. I hate having extra anything on hand. Haha. Simple is the key to me not being all twitchy and crazy. But at least I know that about myself. Haha.\nIt looks absolutely amazing! Also \u2013 you inspired my Pinterest addiction. I just can\u2019t get enough!\nWhat a wonderful hallway. This is like a museum which gathered a lot of lovely prints.\nLove this\u2026.\nLooks great! I love the Clara hanky. I found a few old \u201cF\u201d hankies as an antique store years ago and snatched them all up; this is such a great way to display them.\np.s. can\u2019t wait to see what you do to the paneling in the background! :)\nWow! This looks amazing! Very inspiring.\nI haven\u2019t framed anything too weird, though I did purposely buy wrapping paper at Target after Christmas specifically for putting into frames. I also bought poster board for a puppy art project. I have loads of paint samples sitting around that I\u2019ll never use, so I\u2019m going to put them on her paws and have her run across the paper, then cut out sections and frame them!\nI went on Zazzle and bought some cheapie vintage post cards from every place we\u2019ve lived (DC, AZ, and OH) and added them to our hallway framing arrangement. I love how they look, and it\u2019s reminder of everywhere we\u2019ve been together. I think I love the Arizona one the most\u2026 :)\nLooks great!! Your guests will always love to look at these and changing them over time will be fun too. I am relieved you say that about project progress \u2013 I thought it was only me. 80% of a project in a few hours and then 3 months go by before I finish the last piece. Drives me crazy that I do that!\nI love it! Gallery walls are Kryptonite to me lately. I just finished ours which has a bird, feather or tree theme, as I\u2019m always drawn to those art items.\n*gasp* I love this so much. It\u2019s serene and beautiful and just perfect.\nThanks, Lisa!!!\nOh, I love it! I\u2019ve started a gallery wall in our hallway, but am at a stand still. I\u2019ve been spray painting thrift store frames in my garage b/c a week ago it was so warm out! Now its snowing again, so I\u2019ll have to wait; spray paint and below freezing don\u2019t mix well. Silly Canadian weather! Our daughters name is Violet so I know what you mean about finding items that have Clara\u2019s name on it!\nThat is so gorgeous! The most beautiful gallery wall I\u2019ve ever seen, really!\nWay to go!\nThat looks awesome. I love all the creative little pieces you use instead of portrait pictures!\nWOW, I love it! Great job guys! I could never, ever, EVER, tackle a project like that though. For starters, it would be a one-woman job since my hubby would freak at the thought of that, and also because it took me half a day to do a 5 frame wall collage in our bedroom. It just stresses me out too much, lol. You guys rock!\nI would love to walk down that hallway everyday!", "label": 1}
{"text": "LOCAL LIVE! In Denver, About Denver, Musically Denver!!!!\nJohn Boutt\u00e9 Interview by Abby Ellis-Angell\nBy Abby Ellis-Angell\nAs you listen to John Boutt\u00e9 speak or sing, you will immediately understand he is the living spirit of New Orleans. A member of a Creole family that harks back seven generations in Louisiana, Boutt\u00e9 expresses his love for his hometown, as well as his deep feelings for a nation which he seems to mourn while at the same time holding out hope for its ability to heal itself. Coming up surrounded by music, at the age of 8, he took up the cornet as his main instrument before realizing that he could best express himself through his talents as a vocalist. His voice, which has been described as a \u2018smoldering, spirit-filled tenor\u2019, has garnered him the distinction of being one of this country\u2019s foremost jazz and soul singers, and earned him such honors as OFFBEAT Magazine\u2019s 2003 Male Vocalist of the Year, and the Big Easy Entertainment Awards\u2019 Male Performer of the Year. As is evident from his comprehensive discography, Boutt\u00e9\u2019s talent lends itself to the full meaning of the music of the soul, including jazz, gospel, and blues, to which he adds his own unique flavoring.* During a recent interview while on the road in Vancouver, he addressed a variety of subjects such as his ability to deal with the experience of finding his native city in ruins in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, his decision to make music his life\u2019s work, and what inspires his songwriting.\nIn light of New Orleans\u2019 destruction, how has the musical spirit of the city survived?\nIts spirit has always been strong. You can stop a lot of things, but you can\u2019t stop the music here. The result of the hurricane is that many of us have been spread around the country. Music and art aren\u2019t stagnant. They reflect life, which means they will continue to prevail.\nHow did you handle coming home to find the city in complete ruins?\nI was very fortunate to run into people who opened their arms to me. When I got home I realized I couldn\u2019t call my mother using the same phone number we\u2019d used for 49 years. Little things like that, like knowing that many of the people I had known all my life had died and that the lifestyle we had enjoyed was gone, just broke my heart .I cried every day for two years, which was a good thing, because otherwise I\u2019d have lost my mind. Thinking about the injustice of it all still makes me well up.\nCould you bring yourself to leave it?\nI ain\u2019t going nowhere! Maybe I\u2019m nuts, but I believe the place is special, man! I\u2019ll put it to you like this: I\u2019ve loved many cities in this world, but New Orleans is the only city that\u2019s loved me back! You have to understand the whole spirit behind it. There\u2019s something about its soul and spirit that grabs you and keeps you. People in this city are able to trace their lineage back to their beginnings; this is not true of any other city in this country. It\u2019s like it\u2019s tribal.\nAre you hopeful that the city will be restored?\nSomehow, Mother Nature always seems to return to rectify our distasters. I can tell you that the first time I smelled the Night Jasmine, I knew that things had started to grow back again. It fired my hope and joy, which I believe could never have been destroyed. It\u2019s the people who love this city and who are determined to stay here who are making the difference. They feel it\u2019s their destiny to rebuild it.\nHow do you think the experience changed you?\nIt made me very aware of the impermanence of life., and how precious and fragile it is. \u201cThe Eternal Now\u201d, one of the tunes on my new CD, \u201cGood Neighbor\u201d, resonates much louder for me than ever before. It\u2019s a reminder that we can\u2019t let anything stop us from what we need to do. The situation has also taught me patience, and made me realize that family has become dearer to me than ever before.\nYou mentioned that it also changed your career. How so?\nMy first gig when I got back to the city was at Caf\u00e9 Brazil, a club on Chartres Street, where there was a hodge-podge of street musicians, and professionals. The place was packed. I could feel the tension in the room because of the nine o\u2019clock curfew. I asked everyone in the audience to stand up and scream to release their anger and frustration. Man, I thought the windows were going to be shattered! I think the people fell in love with me, and vice-versa. I knew that they had listened to me before, but then, after the storm, they really began to hear me, and we began to appreciate each other. So now I find that performing in New Orleans is very special because I have a great fan base. The hurricane was a kind of catalyst.\nWhen and how did you decide to make music your life\u2019s work?\nI\u2019ve been involved with music ever since I was born. You can\u2019t live in New Orleans and not get an education in music. I picked up the coronet when I was 8 and started playing with the school marching band, and later with different groups playing Doo Wop and MoTown. When I got home from Korea, I was playing with the older cats, like Ed Frank, Lloyd Lambert, Joseph \u2018Smokey\u2019 Johnson, and Danny Barker\u2026any of the masters that would allow me to hang with them. All this time I had had a banking job at home until one day I met Stevie Wonder who came to town to receive an honorarium at Xavier College, from which I had graduated. The upshot was that when I got to sing for him, he told me I had a \u2018signature voice\u2019, and the next day I quit my job. As luck would have it, my sister Lillian, who is a fine jazz singer, asked me to join her on tour in Europe, where I ended up doing cameo performances with her band.\nWhat made you decide to go out on your own?\nWell, eventually I decided I needed to be doing more than singing with her. Unless I wanted it to become a Donny and Marie situation, I felt I had to break away! I had learned a great deal from her professionally by just watching her dealing with the heartaches and difficulties involved in keeping people on the road.\nWhat inspires you to write your music?\nI believe that all my experiences define me and become part of my music. Sometimes I\u2019m inspired to pull phrases from the Bible. Many times I can find words of wisdom there, as well as the lyrics of hymns. I can sing them to myself. Basically, I feel that my life is about songs that have been sung before me, as well ones that I\u2019m still learning, and those that are in me that are yet to come. I find a lot of solace, wisdom, joy and laughter in them. I can rejoice, I can mourn, and I can relieve my anger, all through the medium of song and singing.\nHow would you best describe your life?\nI guess I\u2019ve always moved with the flow, and it seems to work. I\u2019m fortunate to be in this universe. I\u2019ve had all these experiences\u2026That\u2019s my life\u2026a big old mixture of great songs, great rhythms, and great beats. My life is a song, a continuous song that keeps beating! I don\u2019t think the beat\u2019s ever going to end. It just goes to another level, hopefully to a meaningful, moving ovation, and an encore to a higher ground.\n*John Boutt\u00e9\u2019s discography can be found on his website, www.johnboutte.com\nAbby Ellis-Angell is a freelance writer living in Denver.", "label": 1}
{"text": "After going nearly four years without producing a budget resolution, Senate Democrats today released a plan confirming their mantra about \u201cbalanced\u201d approaches has nothing to do with actually balancing the budget.\nIn their view, \u201cbalance\u201d is a mix of higher taxes and higher spending, chronic deficits and debt, and a relentlessly growing federal government. Those who call this a \u201cradically different\u201d vision from that of House Republicans certainly got that one right.\nUsing the Heritage budget plan, Saving the American Dream, as a benchmark for the fiscal year (FY) 2014 budget, the blueprint presented today by Senate Budget Chairwoman Patty Murray (D\u2013WA) fails on six key criteria.\n1. Fails to Balance. Like President Obama, Senate Democrats don\u2019t even try to balance the budget. They speak of \u201cdeficit reduction,\u201d not balance. In contrast, the House budget resolution balances within 10 years.\nIn one sense, the Senate budget proves the folly of trying to reduce deficits with heavy tax increases. Even with a $975 billion tax hike over 10 years\u2014and this on top of the $618 billion tax increase enacted in January and the new Obamacare taxes\u2014revenue never catches up with the budget\u2019s spending, which never falls below 21 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).\nAs Murray herself noted today, during the budget surplus years of the late 1990s, spending plunged to 18.2 percent of GDP. Senate Democrats have not yet learned that balanced budgets come from spending restraint and a strong economy.\n2. Further Guts Defense. Even without the $43 billion sequestration that started March 1, the national defense budget has been squeezed by Obama\u2019s reductions just when U.S. forces need replenishment and modernization. The House budget resolution provides $6.525 trillion defense funding over 10 years, including activities in Iraq and Afghanistan, by holding base spending at the level of the Budget Control Act caps without sequestration. The Senate budget has a total of $5.867 trillion over 10 years\u2014again including overseas operations\u2014which is $658 billion below the House\u2019s figure.\nThe Senate budget proposal will provide $552 billion in total defense budget authority in FY 2014. This is even less than Obama proposed for FY 2014 in his budget request of last year. Fulfilling U.S. security commitments will require much more funding than the level proposed by the Senate Budget Committee.\n3. No Significant Entitlement Reform. Instead of reforming entitlements, the Senate budget insists on \u201ckeeping promises\u201d it cannot keep. These promises are fiscally unsustainable under the current entitlement structure, and pretending otherwise is irresponsible.\nThe Senate budget resolution outlines the same failed anti-poverty policies that liberals have promoted for decades: pouring more taxpayer dollars into the nation\u2019s ever-expanding means-tested welfare system. These welfare programs undermine work and marriage and promote long-term dependence, which generates the need for even more spending in the future. Despite $20 trillion in spending, the poverty rate has remained virtually unchanged since the beginning of the War on Poverty. Nevertheless, the left continues to claim that the solution is to spend more\u2014and so does the Senate budget.\n4. Retains Obamacare. Rather than reforming the health-care entitlements, the Senate budget leaves Obamacare fully intact, allowing more than $1.8 trillion in new health care spending. At a time when the nation has more than $11 trillion in publicly held debt and annual trillion-dollar budget deficits, such profligate new entitlement spending on the Medicaid expansion and Obamacare\u2019s costly subsidies is irresponsible and nonsensical. Worse, it leaves seniors and the poor with broken government health programs. To improve access to health care and create health care savings, the existing health-care entitlements must be fundamentally reformed, not ignored.\n5. No Serious Reduction in Non-Defense Discretionary Spending. While claiming spending restraint, the Senate budget spends $977 billion more in non-defense discretionary programs than the House budget over 10 years. Indeed, one of the first things the Senate budget does is throw another $100 billion at the kind of infrastructure \u201cstimulus\u201d policies that have failed to stimulate the economy in the past. The budget then brags about its additional \u201cinvestments\u201d in education, job training, and the like. This is not the language of spending restraint.\nThe budget\u2019s education \u201cinvestments\u201d expand Washington\u2019s intervention at all levels. It would expand the federal Head Start program, which has been deemed completely ineffective by the Department of Health and Human Services. Head Start should be eliminated, along with any effort to increase Washington intervention into the early education and care of the youngest Americans.\nThe budget would also increase spending on programs that fall under No Child Left Behind at a time when states are demanding freedom from federal education programs and red tape.\nOver the past four decades, inflation-adjusted federal education spending has nearly tripled. Instead of continuing the education spending spree, which has failed to improve educational outcomes, it is time for long-overdue fiscal austerity at the Department of Education coupled with genuine relief from red tape and federal mandates.\n6. Tax Hikes, Not Tax Reform. Murray\u2019s budget includes a massive tax increase. She raises taxes by almost $1 trillion ($975 billion to be exact) over the next 10 years by \u201cclosing loopholes.\u201d Closing loopholes is Washington-speak for eliminating deductions, exemptions, and credits.\nWhich loopholes to close Murray leaves up to the Senate Finance Committee. But she is pursuing this tax increase unnecessarily. The Congressional Budget Office says that revenues will be 19 percent of GDP at the end of the current 10-year budget window. That is uncomfortably above the 18.5 percent of GDP that tax revenues have averaged in times of economic growth since the end of World War II. Murray\u2019s budget would push revenues close to 20 percent of GDP by 2023, well above average\u2014yet still not enough to catch up with her budget\u2019s excessive spending.\nThe biggest accomplishment for Murray was delivering a budget that will be voted on by the full Senate\u2014or at least promised by Majority Leader Harry Reid (D\u2013NV). It also establishes a meaningful contrast between the vision and robustness of the House Republican plan. On all other counts, the Senate budget misses the mark.\nThe following Heritage experts also contributed to this blog: Baker Spring (national defense) Nina Owcharenko (health care), Lindsey Burke (education), Rachel Sheffield (anti-poverty spending), and Curtis Dubay (taxes", "label": 1}
{"text": "KMC: General, simply for telling these things to us today, you run the risk of being retaliated against by Saddam Hussein's friends and allies, why did you choose to speak out particularly at this time.\nGS: You see actually, I was not speaking this, I was not even writing the book, but, what happened in year 2004 on 26th of April, when the terrorists wanted to explode many tons of these same chemical weapons that we had in Jordan, Amman, and they were trying to destroy the prime minister's office, and the Jordanian Intelligence and the American Embassy. You see 20,000 people were expected to die of that explosion. As a friendly country, Jordan, the Jordan which I love, this had effected on me very much, and then on Feb. 2, 2005, I was in a conference in Phoenix, Ariz., where I met my two friends, Michael Coleman and Dr. Teddy Lowe of World Compassion. They listened to these stories that I had mentioned in the conference. They came and asked me very warmly to make the book of this because this is very important and these informations. So I was persuaded by their two people to write the book, and since Feb. 2, 2005, till now we have worked on the book.\nKMC: Let's talk about who you are ... what was your rank within the Saddam Hussein regime?\nGS: I was the air-wise marshall, in the Air Force, (second highest rank in the Iraqi military) and I was one of the people who did not attend the Baath Party. And that's why I was forced to retire in 1986.\nKMC: You were never a member of the Baath Party?\nGS: No never ... And they asked me in '86, it is not possible to be in this rank and second man in the air force and you are not a Baath Party. I said \"sorry I can not attend that party, because you said in your principles that the body of the party is Arab, and the spirit of the party is Islam. And myself am neither Arab nor Muslim. I am an Assyrian Christian; therefore I don't fit in this party. And I'm sorry to tell you. I don't want to bluff you ... I just can not attend.\"\nThey said, \"OK, if you will not attend the party then you will be retired.\"\nI said, \"OK, let me retire.\"\nSo I was retired in '86, but when Saddam invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990, I was the first man to be recalled again to join the active duty, by the regime, by Saddam and to be the adviser on the air force.\nNow, for every liberal who claimed Bush lied. For every printed article that passed on the claim, and every TV channel that did as well. Will you devote yourself to pursuing the claims of Gen. Sada as aggressively as you passed on the disinformation about Bush's truthfulness?\nThe nation waits!\nPanetta: Republican Congress \"Most Difficult I've Seen in 50 Years of Public Service\" | Nicole Bailey\nObligatory Video: Obama and Ra\u00fal Castro Shake Hands at Memorial Service For Nelson Mandela | Daniel Doherty", "label": 1}
{"text": "Greyhound Lines Inc. didn\u2019t take long to try to reclaim a share of the U.S. bus market from newer rivals.\nThe Dallas-based unit of Aberdeen, Scotland-based FirstGroup Plc (FGP) offered $1 one-way fares yesterday to passengers stranded after the U.S. Transportation Department shut down 26 discount bus companies as imminent safety hazards. The shutdowns affected dozens of routes out of New York\u2019s Chinatown in the largest U.S. safety sweep of the motorcoach industry.\n\u201cThe well-run operators are very pleased with this announcement, because it highlights the way these bad guys operate,\u201d said Dan Ronan, a spokesman for the Washington-based American Bus Association, whose members include Greyhound and Stagecoach Group Plc (SGC)\u2019s Megabus.\nThe crackdown comes at a time higher gasoline costs, time- consuming airline security and amenities like free Wi-Fi have made bus travel a desirable option for more affluent riders, students and women traveling alone, according to a DePaul University study released last year. Companies, such as the Chinatown carriers, that pick up passengers at curbsides to cut costs instead of at terminals grew by 32 percent last year in terms of scheduled departures.\nThe American Bus Association has been calling for a crackdown on unsafe operators and supports the Transportation Department\u2019s effort, Ronan said in an e-mailed statement.\n\u201cAnytime one of these bad guys has a bad accident it puts pressure on the entire industry and it takes a hit,\u201d he said.Safety Rules\nThe Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration\u2019s enforcement action primarily targeted three Chinatown operations in New York and Philadelphia: Apex Bus Inc., I-95 Coach Inc. and New Century Travel Inc. The government ordered 10 bus company owners, managers and employees to cease all passenger transportation business, including selling tickets, according to a Transportation Department statement.\n\u201cBy ignoring safety rules, these operators put passengers and other motorists at risk,\u201d Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood said in a phone news conference yesterday. \u201cThis is a notice to every bus company out there. Follow the rules and keep people safe, or we will shut you down.\u201d\nThe crackdown followed a yearlong investigation that began shortly after a series of fatal crashes last year, Federal Motor Carrier Administrator Anne Ferro said yesterday.\nFatal crashes surged last year as intercity bus travel became the fastest-growing U.S. mode of commercial transportation. In 2011, at least 28 people died in eight fatal crashes, including three in an 11-week period involving carriers operating out of, or carrying passengers between, Chinatown neighborhoods in East Coast cities.Curbside Operators\nCurbside bus operators have a fatal crash rate seven times higher than terminal-based operations, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board reported in October.\nThe three primary targets in the U.S. crackdown controlled a network of other companies, leading to the 26 separate shutdown orders, the Transportation Department said. The companies\u2019 networks included one ticket seller, nine active bus companies, 13 companies already ordered out of service that were continuing to operate and three companies applying for permission to operate.\nThe department\u2019s actions cover companies operating in New York, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Maryland and Indiana. Besides New York and Philadelphia, there are affected routes in Washington; Atlanta; Richmond, Virginia; Charlotte, North Carolina; Orlando, Florida and more than 20 other locations, according to a Transportation Department fact sheet.Multiple Violations\nThe carriers involved had multiple safety violations, including drivers without valid commercial licenses and drivers violating federal driving-time limits; failure to test for drugs and alcohol; and vehicles that hadn\u2019t been regularly inspected or repaired.\nSophia Xu, who sells tickets at I-95 Coach in New York\u2019s Chinatown at 87 Chrystie Street, said Transportation Department officials came to the shop May 30 and said the company needed to close, without explaining why.\nSigns posted on the glass outside and inside at the ticket counter gave a phone number to call for online ticket refunds and say people who paid cash can get refunds at the counter.\nChen Chen, a fellow ticket seller, said Chinatown buses are being unfairly targeted.\n\u201cThis doesn\u2019t happen to Greyhound,\u201d he said, holding a Chinese-language newspaper with pictures from the shop of police he said were rude.\nThe buses are safe, the two workers said.$20 Tickets\nA few people wandered to the New Century\u2019s Washington office on H Street to find a handwritten sign taped to the front gate, \u201cDon\u2019t go upstairs -- Close.\u201d\nIf New Century gets back in business, Oliver Oree said he wouldn\u2019t hesitate to use the line again.

{"text": "Dorthy Moxley had nothing special planned for Jan. 18\u2013tennis with friends in the morning, bridge in the afternoon\u2013until a 9:30 a.m. phone call brought news she had waited more than 24 years to hear: Frank Garr, an inspector with the Connecticut state's attorney's office, told her there would be a major announcement concerning the long-unresolved investigation of the death of Moxley's 15-year-old daughter, Martha, whose savage 1975 murder outside the family's Greenwich, Conn., home has been generating headlines ever since.\n\"Oh, Frank, I'm not going to be disappointed, am I?\" implored Moxley, 67. \"No,\" said Garr, \"I think you'll be pleased.\"\nMoxley settled into a chair in her Chatham, N.J., living room and looked up at an oil portrait of her daughter, forever young, blonde and smiling. \"Martha, we're getting him,\" she said through bittersweet tears. \"We're going to get him.\"\nThe next day, the announcement was made that the Moxleys' onetime Greenwich neighbor Michael Skakel, 39, had been charged with Martha's murder. Skakel, a nephew of Ethel Kennedy, turned himself in to police in Greenwich later that day and was released on $500,000 bond to return to his home in wealthy Hobe Sound, Fla.\nSkakel, speaking through his lawyer, maintains his innocence, as he has since he was first questioned by police nearly a quarter century ago. His good character is vouched for by, among others, his first cousin Douglas Kennedy, 32, son of Robert and Ethel Kennedy and a reporter with FOX News Channel. \"Michael is one of the most honest and open people I know,\" says Kennedy. \"He cares about people more than anybody I've ever met, and there is no possible way he's involved in this.\"\nProving who was\ninvolved in the Moxley murder will present staggering difficulties to the prosecution. Greenwich police, deferential to local gentry such as the Skakels, never searched the Skakel house thoroughly after the killing\u2013though the golf club with which Martha was bludgeoned belonged to the family\u2013and also failed to properly secure the crime scene. Consequently, there is little physical evidence upon which a case might be built. Yet a 1996 episode of the TV show Unsolved Mysteries\nled to new information and helped prompt the impaneling in 1998 of a one-man grand jury in the person of Connecticut Superior Court Judge George Thim. He heard testimony from 53 witnesses, including former residents of a pricey drug-and-alcohol rehab facility where Skakel allegedly discussed his role in the Moxley murder while under treatment in the late '70s.\nThe case is further complicated by the fact that Skakel was 15 at the time of Moxley's murder and will face trial as a juvenile unless state attorneys persuade a judge to move the proceedings to superior court. Frank Garr, who was a patrolman with the Greenwich police in 1975, concedes, \"An arrest is just the first step. We have a long road ahead.\"\nFor Dorthy Moxley, the road has already been long. She saw her daughter for the last time on Oct. 30, 1975, the day before Halloween, as Martha, bundled against the cold in her blue down jacket, happily set off to engage in a few pre-Halloween pranks with other kids from the neighborhood. \"She's with me all the time,\" says Moxley. \"I'll open my recipe book, and there will be a card that she wrote out for lemon squares. I'll open a box of stationery, and there's a Mother's Day card she made for me.\"\nDorthy saw no reason to fear for Martha's safety that evening. Belle Haven, the Greenwich neighborhood where the Moxleys had moved from Piedmont, Calif., 16 months earlier, was an enclave of big houses, pampered lawns and streets guarded by a private security detail. The Moxleys\u2013Dorthy, her late husband, David, an accountant, and their two children, Martha and John, then 17\u2013felt at home among their new neighbors. The presence of the Kennedy-connected Skakels\u2013Michael's father, Rushton, is Ethel Kennedy's older brother\u2013only enhanced the neighborhood's atmosphere of exclusivity and privilege. Rushton Skakel had recently recommended David Moxley for membership at Manhattan's University Club.\nProbably no place in Greenwich or in all of Connecticut seemed safer than Belle Haven, yet Martha never came home that night. Dorthy waited anxiously by a window in the library of the family's sprawling Spanish-style house. Before dawn her concern had turned to panic. That afternoon Martha's body was found hidden beneath the low branches of an evergreen on the Moxley property. Lying facedown with her jeans and underwear near her ankles, Martha had been beaten with such force that the six-iron golf club used in the attack had shattered into three parts, one of which had been driven through her neck.\nThe discovery in the Skakel house of a set of matching clubs with a missing six-iron immediately cast suspicion on the Moxleys' neighbors. Tommy Skakel, then 17, the third of Rushton Skakel's seven children by his first wife, Ann, who had died of cancer in 1973, was known to have had a crush on Martha\u2013Tommy kept trying to get to \"first and second base,\" the teenager had written in her diary\u2013and was the last person seen with her before she was killed. He insisted then, as he does now, that he didn't murder Moxley. Another member of the Skakel household, live-in tutor Kenneth Littleton, then 23, also fell under scrutiny but was eventually dropped from the list of suspects because no evidence or motive linked him to the crime.\nFrom the beginning, Dorthy Moxley kept a certain distance from the brutal facts of the investigation. \"I never knew which tree Martha was found under or where things happened,\" she says. \"I thought if I did not know, it wouldn't hurt so much.\" For a time, the Moxleys remained friendly with the Skakels and even once visited the family's ski lodge in Windham, N.Y. But relations soured when the Skakels stopped cooperating with police in 1976, by which time Tommy Skakel had emerged as the prime suspect.\nSoon the Moxleys could no longer bear living in their big house in Belle Haven. \"We were convinced that whoever killed Martha had to have been someone who lived across the street at the Skakels',\" says Dorthy. The family moved to Manhattan, then, in 1986, to Annapolis, Md. Two years later, David Moxley, who rarely spoke of his daughter's murder, died of a heart attack at age 57. \"I think the fact that he kept everything inside added to his early demise,\" says Dorthy, who herself fell into a deep depression.\nBack in Greenwich, where police had scant experience with serious crime, the Moxley investigation meandered along inconclusively. By and large, the Skakels, even while shadowed by suspicion, managed to get on with their lives\u2013all of them, that is, except Michael, a troubled child who struggled with dyslexia and drank heavily in his teens. According to Greenwich native Timothy Dumas, whose account of the Moxley murder, Greentown\n, was published in 1998, Skakel had a short temper and was reputed to have beaten squirrels to death with a golf club.\nOne family member, who prefers to go unnamed, says Michael's problems date back to his mother's death. \"He was never told what was happening,\" says the source. \"His mom was taken away to the hospital, and the next thing he knew, she was dead.\" In 1978 Michael was arrested for drunk driving after a high-speed chase in Upstate New York. He was sent by his father\u2013himself a heavy drinker who relied largely on servants to raise his children\u2013to the Elan School in Poland Spring, Maine, a private facility then specializing in turning around the lives of troubled rich kids through tough love and discipline.\nBy all accounts, Elan was a bad fit for Skakel, who ran away several times. According to a written proposal for a book about his life (titled Dead Man Talking\n) that Skakel and a ghostwriter circulated among publishers a couple of years ago, Skakel wore a sign reading \"Confront me on why I killed my friend Martha\" during his time at Elan. He left the school after two years and spent much of the '80s on the golf course, on ski slopes and in and out of rehab clinics. Supported by his father, he competed on the international speed skiing circuit and came close to qualifying for a U.S. demonstration team that took part in the 1992 winter Olympics in Albertville, France.\nFriends at the time describe Skakel as gentle and generous. \"When I was training, he helped me a great deal,\" says Kazunaga Kusumi, now 33, a member of the Japanese Olympic team. \"He'd share his equipment, which is really rare for a competitor.\" In the early '90s, Skakel married golf pro Margot Sheridan, now 36, and settled in the affluent Boston suburb of Cohasset, Mass., near Skakel's cousin Michael Kennedy, who would die in an Aspen ski accident in 1997. In 1993, at age 32, Skakel earned his bachelor's degree from Curry College in Milton, Mass., and went on to work as a driver for Ted Kennedy's 1994 reelection campaign.\nFor a time, it seemed that Skakel had slipped free of the long shadow of the Moxley case. But in 1991, another Kennedy cousin, William Kennedy Smith, was tried in West Palm Beach, Fla., on rape charges. Smith, then 30, was acquitted, but his trial spurred rumors that he had been at the Skakel home on the night of the Moxley murder. The rumors proved false, but in an effort to clear his family's name once and for all, Rushton Skakel hired a team of private investigators, Sutton Associates, to examine the facts of the Moxley case once again.\nThis, evidently, was a disastrous miscalculation. In interviews with Sutton investigators\u2013later leaked to New York City reporter Leonard Levitt, Connecticut cops and the authors of three books\u2013both Tommy and Michael Skakel drastically altered their accounts of events on the night of Oct. 30, 1975. Tommy, who originally claimed he and Moxley had briefly flirted on the lawn before he last saw her walking toward her house at 9:30 p.m., now told the Sutton team that he and Martha had been masturbating each other before parting at around 10 p.m. Michael, who had told cops he was far from the scene at a cousin's house, now added that, after returning home, he climbed a tree, where he too masturbated, outside Moxley's bedroom.\nThe Skakels' bizarre disclosures and the apparent revision of their stories heightened interest in the case once again. Disgraced former Los Angeles police detective Mark Fuhrman, famous for his role in the O.J. Simpson trial, investigated the facts of the case and came up with his own theory: that the Skakel who had killed Martha Moxley was Michael, not Tommy. \"One, the murder weapon came from the Skakel home,\" says Fuhrman, who detailed his hypothesis in his 1998 book Murder in Greenwich\n. \"Two, the Skakel boys were the last ones to see her alive. Three, Michael lied to police, which eliminated him as a suspect in 1975. Then he told a different story\u2013a whopper of a story\u2013in 1992 that put himself all over the murder scene.\"\nFuhrman also says he talked to former Elan School students who claim Michael Skakel admitted involvement in the murder\u2013a claim Michael's counsel, Mickey Sherman, a frequent TV legal analyst, dismisses as unfounded hearsay.\nSince 1998, when Connecticut investigators at last compiled enough evidence to convene the grand jury that would lead to the murder charge, Skakel, his wife and their son George, now 14 months old, have lived largely incommunicado in a condo in a gated community in Hobe Sound, close to the home of Michael's father. Friends seeing Michael's picture today are shocked by his gray hair, not long ago blond, and the extra pounds he now carries on his formerly athletic frame. \"This has ruined his life,\" says a relative, referring to the Moxley case.\nYet one person's ordeal may be another's deliverance. Dorthy Moxley, who derives her greatest pleasure from her remaining family\u2013son John, 41, a Manhattan real estate executive, his wife, Kara, and their two children, Caroline, 8, and David, 6\u2013says she is at last ready to confront the full facts of her daughter's murder. \"I am definitely going to this trial,\" she vows. \"Wild horses couldn't keep me away.\"\nPatrick RogersJennifer Longley\nin Greenwich\n- Contributors:\n- Jennifer Longley.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Florida blocks cities, counties from voting on sick pay laws\nBy Steve Almasy\n(CNN) \u2014 Florida\u2019s governor has signed a law that says cities and counties cannot make businesses offer paid sick leave.\nSupporters say the law will mean consistency for employers across the state. Opponents say it burdens the poor and working mothers who cannot afford to lose money to stay at home sick or who are taking care of someone who is ill.\nAmong the companies that had lobbied for the law are Walt Disney and Darden Restaurants, which operates Olive Garden and Red Lobster, CNN affiliate WESH reported.\nGov. Rick Scott, a Republican, signed the bill into law Friday, saying it \u201cfosters statewide uniformity, consistency and predictability in Florida\u2019s employer-employee relationships.\u201d\nHe said the law is business friendly and supports job creation.\nThe move came as Orange County, which includes Orlando, was considering letting voters decide on a sick pay measure.\nThe bill\u2019s sponsor in the Florida Senate, David Simmons, told WESH that the law signals that cities and counties cannot \u201ccreate their own patchwork of regulations\u201d in regards to employee benefits.\nOrlando-based Organize Now had petitioned Scott to veto the bill.\n\u201cThe fight for earned sick time will continue,\u201d it said on its Facebook page. \u201cFloridians believe in earned sick time for hardworking families and we don\u2019t give up when we believe in something. \u2026 and we won\u2019t forget.\u201d\nThe law takes effect on July 1.\nSan Francisco was the first city to mandate sick pay, with the measure passing in 2007.

{"text": "The debate about the relationship between the end (the transformation of society) and the means (the compromises dictated by economic \"realism\") has long been a favourite in left-wing circles. The appearance of several left-leaning governments in Europe - Labour in Britain, the forces of the left in France, the post-communist centre in Italy and the \"red-green\" one in Germany - has generated a flood of articles analysing the differences between their various approaches.\nThough the electoral issues and the shape of the ruling coalitions in these four countries are far from identical, their ways of approaching the problems of government are becoming increasingly similar. To the point that it\u2019s becoming a waste of time trying to spot the differences. Where is the real difference between the \"left liberal\" team headed by Tony Blair and the government of Lionel Jospin, which was ill-advisedly presented as less likely to pander to big business? At least the British prime minister - who often seems like a man searching for the Holy Grail of a Thatcherism with a human face - has been pushing for a minimum wage and new trade union rights. His French counterpart, Lionel Jospin - who says he will not be held accountable for the socially and morally unjustifiable legacy of the Mitterand presidency - has taken on board one of its emblematic features: pressing for progressive social reforms (forever promised and always postponed) as a way of improving his chances of pushing through a policy of neo-liberal modernisation (which, unlike the reforms, rolls on at an alarming rate).\nIn Germany, Oskar Lafontaine talked about re-asserting the power of democratic governments against the arrogance of the central banks. For a few weeks he looked quite promising. But his apparent surrender now shows that, in Berlin, Paris and Rome, the only real ambition of the left, once in government, has been to smooth the way for big-money interests. Privatisation, pension funds, social austerity, respecting the stability pact, and no political will to deal with unemployment and social insecurity. This appears to be the programme, made all the easier by the smaller parties in the coalitions, who too often make purely formal concessions in order to look good in front of the TV cameras.\nThe collapse of the right in Europe should have made it possible to embark on alternative economic and social policies. Instead, it has been used by the parliamentary left as a way of establishing themselves as managers of the neo-liberal world order.\nOf course, people are resisting neo-liberalism all over the world. But resistance does not make for a movement, nor a movement a programme, and even a programme does not mean a policy. So we are back to the dialectic between the means and the end.

Each team is coming into play still searching for their first conference victory as both come in with a 0-6 NEC record.\nLast One\nThe Bobcats had a couple intrastate contests against Sacred Heart and Central Conn. St. last weekend. Quinnipiac had an opening to win the first set against the Pioneers as they were up 25-24 but lost the last three points and came away with a straight set defeat. Traveling to New Britain to face off against the Blue Devils of Central Conn. St., Quinnipiac couldn't pull out a victory, losing in straight sets, 3-0.\nAll-Time Against St. Francis (N.Y.)\nThe Bobcats have dominated the Terriers in recent memory with a 13-5 all-time record. After beginning the series with a 8-1 record in the first nine games played, St. Francis has closed the gap with the Bobcats holding a slight 5-4 record in the past nine games. Quinnipiac swept the season series against St. Francis last season with a 3-2 win at home and 3-0 victory on the road.\nScouting the Terries\nSt. Francis owns a 2-21 overall record in 2012 with a 0-6 mark in NEC play. Their two victories came against St. Peter's College, 3-0, on Sept. 5 and Fordham on Sept. 25, 3-2. They come in riding a four-game losing streak but played their last two opponents, Robert Morris and St. Francis (Pa.), tough with a pair of 3-1 defeats. The Terries rank near the bottom in conference-games only, just ahead of Quinnipiac in eight place, in hitting percentage (.137), opponent hitting percentage (.265), assists (9.00 per game) and kills (9.40 per game). The strongest part of their game is their defensive ability as they rank sixth in NEC play with 1.65 blocks per game and fifth in digs at 14.15 per game. The Terrier offense is led by Slavica Stefanovic whose 147 kills and 23 service aces lead the team.

{"text": "In the background, I have been working very hard on a video in my free time that will go live tomorrow, which I hope will be of interest to my viewers. I\u2019m a little disappointed in the quality of the audio in some sections, but I will work on this with future videos.\nAnyway, as happens, I tend to refer to the science literature and in doing so, I came across Awofeso (2012) Ethics of Artificial Water Fluoridation in Australia. Public Health Ethics. 5 (2): 161-172. (doi: 10.1093/phe/phs016).\nWhile I will not go through the entire article \u2013 many points made in it are discussed in the video \u2013 there are a couple points I would like to raise that hit me in the face not unlike \u201cPythonesque fish slap\u201d when I read it.\n\u201cEpidemiological trends do not fully support effectiveness of artificial water fluoridation in both caries prevention and reducing relatively high rates of dental caries among vulnerable populations. A recent report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare revealed that Australian children from the poorest areas have about 70 per cent more dental decay compared with children from the highest socioeconomic groups. For example, in Western Australia, where over 90 per cent of water supplies are fluoridated, dental decay was 22 per cent higher in poorer cohorts compared with richer socioeconomic populations. This report also noted that caries prevalence varied from 29.3 per cent in the Australian Capital Territory to 49.7 per cent in the Northern Territory, average national prevalence of 38 per cent. (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, 2011a). This compares with a national average of 40 per cent caries prevalence in the 1970s (Wilson, 2004). Thus, there is little epidemiological evidence to suggest that widespread adoption of water fluoridation has translated into substantial reduction in caries prevalence in Australia.\u201d\nThe author makes a number of inappropriate claims from comparisons being made. To make sense of the potential influences of water fluoridation on different socio-economic groups, the comparison must be made between similar groups of different fluoridation cover rather than between socio-economic groups within the one cover region.\nFor instance, you would standardise income across your research area (what you can buy for a dollar does change across Australia) and then cluster your groups by this standard income. You would then look at a given standardised income group across different communities where the difference is the amount of access to fluoridated water.\nStating that WA has 90% fluoridated water cover and that lower socio-economic groups has higher rates of tooth decay ONLY concludes that there are social and economic factors as to why poorer people have more tooth decay and cannot state whether or not rates of tooth decay in more vulnerable groups has or has not been improved by access to fluoridated water at all.\nFurthermore, comparing ACT to NT is just as misleading. Firstly, the Qld state government have this nice graphic, showing that 70% of people in the NT have access to Fluoride, while 100% of people in ACT do. The ACT is a very small and highly urbanised state, while the NT is huge and has many people living in remote communities with little access to everything from fresh fruit and vegetables to quality doctors and educators.\nTaking a quick look at the ABS census data, whatever measure you care to use, NT rates lower than ACT for income as well (not standardised). Again both access to fluoridated water and socio-economic factors are likely involved and no meaningful conclusions on the effectiveness of water fluoridation can be drawn.\nA clear case of \u201capples and oranges\u201d is developed to wrongly suppose that fluoridation is ineffective, which is then used like a domino to support other claims (such as, cost \u2013 clearly, if it is ineffective the cost is too great).\nOn cost, the author writes;\n\u201c[T]he assumptions underlying the cost-effectiveness calculations were not stated. It is debatable that $1 invested in water fluoridation translates to $30 saved in dental treatment, because not all those affected by dental caries will lose days off work or seek treatment. Also, it is not mentioned if the cost of fluorosis treatment (lifetime treatment costs of $100,000) is included in the cost-effectiveness calculations (Clinch, 2008).\u201d\nAgain, many sleights of hand are being used.\nFirst, the argument can easily be turned on fluorosis treatment; not everyone whom develops fluorosis will seek treatment.\nThe rates of fluorosis in fluoridated regions of Australia are relatively low when compared with rates of tooth decay in areas without fluoridated water supply (eg 56% of children between 5-12 years of age have experienced caries in NSW, Child Dental Health Survey 2007, Phelan et al (2009), where fluorosis levels are never claimed to be as high anywhere in Australia), so it is understandable that costs in relation to fluorosis are subjective and unlikely to be comparable to costs resulting from dental caries.\nWater fluoridation has time and time again, proven to be safe, cost effective and effective to reduce the rate of tooth caries (also demonstrated in the NSW survey).\nAs a final point, the author discusses ethics drawing back to the question of \u201cautonomy.\u201d\nThis is the refuge of the fool, akin to the pathetic whining we heard in relation to phasing out old technology light globes; \u201cthey\u2019re telling us even what type of light globe we can use.\u201d\nIt is a philosophical question that indeed deserves debate, but only in relation to meaningful subjects. Stressing over light bulbs and 1ppm levels of fluoride in ones drinking water are not subjects worth such debate.\nThere are many limitations to what the individual can actually do in practice. We do not even have legal responsibility over our own life; we can be kept alive against our will. On the question on the amount of power an individual can own and yield, we limit this to guns of varying level and more often they are not carried into public places.\nThe standing scientific literature on the subject of water fluoridation demonstrates that, if it is applied within the World Health Organisation guidelines, it is effective and safe. It is also cheap. With that in mind, knowing that teeth everywhere are surprisingly alike, what ethical grounds remain for an individual to complain, \u201cit\u2019s against my freedom to be provide cost effective dental decay protection by the government! Who the hell are they to extend my life and the quality of my teeth?\u201d\nI will go into more detail in the following video and have done so in my form articles on the subject.\nAwofeso (2012) has produced a terrible report, full of obvious biases and misleading comparisons to drawn unsubstantiated claims contrary to more than 40 years of real world evidence across Australia. I would have hoped that the review panel of Public Health Ethics should have heard numerous alarm bells ringing from such blatantly wrong and misleading word play. Clearly, in this example, they did their journal no favours.\nReally the only way to compare is to look at the same socio economic group that do and don\u2019t have fluoride , Even then there maybe other factors one I heard of is the rise of bottled water consumption . Really if there so worried about it raise money to buy people who one a water filter .\nnice analyses of the flaws here Tim .\nCheers David\u2026 They could just take a short cut and pay for Chris Monckton to present on fluoridation being a Chinese communist plot to take over the democratic west. He\u2019s always the gun for hire on indefensible topics.\nI hope that he fucking sues you \u2013 you are a dumb cretin!\nSues me? For what? Pointing out inaccurate comparisons used to draw conclusions that simply do not result from them? If it becomes law that one cannot point out error in others conclusions, welcome back to the dark ages.\nClean up the language and find error in my review, rather than insulting me personally or take your filth elsewhere.

Today is one of those days.\nThis morning I received an email from a \u201cfriend\u201d that included a testimonial for my new book. When I saw his email sitting in my inbox, I was excited. \u201cI wonder what amazing things he\u2019s going to say about it,\u201d I thought to myself. All the other testimonials I\u2019ve received for the book have been stellar.\nBut when I opened the email, my heart sank. It was full of destructive criticism.\nI didn\u2019t necessarily disagree with some of the points he made, but his delivery was callous and cold. The critical words hit me like a punch in the face.\nMy initial reaction was to get upset. I shed some tears. I blamed myself.\nI completely disregarded the fact that the e-mail was from a person who is famous for his obsession with domination and control.\nI ignored the facts and instead got angry with myself for not being perfect. \u201cWhy can\u2019t I just do better?\u201d I asked the Universe. \u201cWhen am I going to get it right?\u201d\nImmediately I received a vision in my mind of a picture that I drew when I was eight years old. The crayon drawing featured a unicorn galloping across a rainbow. My mom loved the picture so much that she used to carry it around in her purse to share with others.\n\u201cWas your drawing \u2018perfect\u2019?\u201d the Universe asked me.\nI smiled as I pondered the question. The drawing was far from perfect. In fact, the rainbow was severely jagged and the unicorn looked like a deformed elephant. But amidst the juvenile imperfection of my work, something beautiful shone through.\nMy mom knew how to see the beauty in my artwork, as parents often do. She could sense the perfection beyond the imperfection. My drawing wasn\u2019t flawless, but she knew I had done my very best.\nI thought about the unicorn drawing in relation to my book. Had I done my best? Without a doubt. Am I happy with the results? Absolutely. Is there room for improvement? Of course!\nOn our spiritual journey, there is always room for improvement. Divine beings never get it \u201cperfect\u201d because the very word \u201cperfect\u201d implies a sense of completion. How can infinite beings get something \u201cperfect\u201d if we are unfolding forever?\nMy book isn\u2019t perfect, but it is awesome. In the words of one of my readers, \u201cit\u2019s going to kick ass and change lives.\u201d\nSo as a recovering perfectionist, let me offer you a word of advice: don\u2019t try to be perfect. Your imperfection is what makes you perfect.\nThe secret to a happy life is learning how to see this kind of divine perfection in ourselves as well as in others.\nYou don\u2019t have to be perfect to be awesome.\nYou just have to be yourself.\nKaren Bell is a blogger & spiritual superhero from London, Ontario, Canada.

{"text": "By Rep\nThere's an old joke about a married couple that's asked about their hobbies and interests. The husband says he's focused on \"important things\" -- like the federal budget, health care reform and peace in the Middle East. The wife says she's focused on the \"small things\" -- like their household budget, their children's health care and keeping peace within their family.\nThere's an important truth here. The things that women focus on and the decisions they make are often unappreciated -- but they're're a majority of the U.S. workforce.\nDespite all the challenges that our nation faces -- from the economy to health care to the national debt -- this is an exciting time for American women. When it comes to our quality of life and the opportunities before us, there has never been a better time and place to be a woman than today in the United States.\nThat's what makes the Democrats' message to American women so strange and unsettling. For the past few months, the Democrats have been accusing Republicans of waging a \"war on women\" as if some honest disagreements between the parties -- over matters like how an \"Obamacare\" mandate should affect religious institutions or the proper scope of federal law on tribal land -- constitute a deliberate GOP campaign to take away women's rights.\nNothing could be further from the truth, and Republican women have been at the forefront exposing these myths. Let's face it: Republican women -- like us -- would never be part of a party that didn't believe in women's --' Big Government policies. The Democrats showed their hand recently with their \"Life of Julia\" infographic. The Obama campaign used this to illustrate how a typical woman is dependent on government programs from birth to death -- and how the GOP is supposedly undermining those programs.\nLeaving aside that everything the \"Julia\" campaign said about Republicans is either mostly wrong or totally wrong, \"Julia's\" life is not typical of American women. Nor is it something that we aspire to. We don't see our lives as a product of government handouts. In fact, we resent the idea that we owe our success to bureaucrats, and not our own initiative.\nThe real reason Democrats manufactured \"Julia\" and the \"war on women\" is because women don't support their policies. In 2010, Republicans won the women's vote for the first time since Ronald Reagan. We fired the first woman speaker of the House, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, because we didn't like the direction Democrats were taking our country -- on the economy, on health care and especially on the debt. We still don't like it today.\nWhen Republicans talk about freedom, entrepreneurship, patient-centered health care and fiscal responsibility, most women respond positively. And when Republicans propose policies grounded in those principles -- reducing taxes on small businesses, shrinking the deficit through the Ryan plan, and repealing \"Obamacare\" -- women see that it's the Republican Party that's advancing their values, not the Democrats.\nThe Republican Party is the real party of American women. And women have played a huge role in our party's success. We have a dynamic group of 24 women in the House, including a record nine freshmen. Four of the six women governors today are Republicans. We're -- and America needs.\nIf the Democrats think we'll be silent on women's issues -- or any issue -- they should think again.", "label": 1}

A reason that half don't pay any taxes might have something to do with creating an obligation or a reliance on government to insure reelection. Do not underestimate this factor. You can give credit on the rising cost of living to the Federal Reserve and no gold standard for our currency. Most all price increases you can trace back to government. Businesses mostly just pass price increases along in their product prices. Wages are competitive in a free society. This is the real point that needs to be addressed. You can't dictate that businesses pay a living wage without government intervening into business and that in previous times is called Marxism. Don't want to go there. Jobs were not shipped overseas, companies had to maintain their costs to be able to sell their products. The price of products is very competitive. People like you and I buy price. Compete or go out of business. I have never seen a company making a reasonable profit able to increase profits to an excessive levels because of competition. Most all companies struggle to keep a minimum profit margin. Record profits just mean you made more than you made last year. Might be just a penny more. The big rich oil companies have a profit margin of about 6 to 9%. Not much considering the risk they take, the government regulations and they could make 5% by investing their money in bonds.\nWant to participate in the conversation? Become a subscriber today.

{"text": "The Institute has recently received, as a gift from the Minneapolis Tower Company, a marble bust of George Washington by Hiram Powers. During the coming week the bust will be exhibited in the Rotunda in commemoration of the birth date of America\u2019s first President. Although it is not so appealing, and certainly not so idealized, as some of the painted portraits of Washington, this bust is characterized by the simplicity and directness that marked Powers\u2019 work in the field in which he excelled. Even today, when his imaginative creations are generally considered to be weak and sentimental, his busts of men are recognized as faithful, convincing portraits. Powers himself thought of them as inconsequential beside such works as The Greek Slave and Eve Disconsolate. Yet it is by the male busts that Powers\u2019 reputation as a sculptor is measured. He was one of the first American artists to turn to sculpture, and it is to his credit that he succeeded in impressing the art of sculpture on the American mind. He was largely self-taught, but his achievements in his chosen field, however primitive they may in many respects appear to be today, helped to lay the foundation for what was to come in the way of American sculpture.Powers was born in Woodstock, Vermont in 1805. When he was still a boy his family moved to Cincinnati, and it was there that he discovered his ability to model faces. Following a period of employment in a dime museum, where he modelled wax figures and later made portraits of celebrities, Powers realized that a larger field lay ahead of him. After studying briefly with a German modeller in Cincinnati he went to Washington, where he received several commissions. Some two years thereafter he found it possible to go to Italy.Powers established himself in Florence, where Horatio Greenough, who had preceded him by twelve years, welcomed and assisted him. Powers also made the acquaintance of Hawthorne, and it is interesting to note that the famous author found him a stimulating companion whose comments were worthy of frequent quotation in the Italian Notebook. It was in Florence that Powers produced The Greek Slave, which brought him instant fame on both sides of the Atlantic. In America the nudity of one of the first nudes by a native sculptor was conceded to be so chaste and so moving that it was unanimously acknowledged with pride by the artist\u2019s fellow countrymen. Numerous reproductions of the figure were made, one of them reputedly bringing the large sum of eleven thousand dollars at the sale of the celebrated Demidoff Collection.Today, however, The Greek Slave has lost its power to charm. Powers\u2019 place in American sculpture is seen to rest rather on male busts such as that of Washington now in the Institute. The portrait, formerly in the collection of Joseph Drexel, of Philadelphia, is one of three busts of Washington placed by Wilbur B. Foshay in the tower which bears his name. The three busts, one in marble and two in bronze, were unveiled when the Foshay Tower was dedicated as a Washington memorial in the late summer of 1929. Another replica of this marble bust, executed in Florence in 1853, is in Mount Vernon. As a portrait of the first President of the United States and as an example of early native sculpture, it is a welcome addition to the American collection.\nView Text Item", "label": 1}

In addition to a range of interesting soups, there are also casseroles, quiches, salads, desserts, and any number of other offerings.\nI placed the first experimental order with the Soup Peddler and eagerly awaited delivery. The soup came minimally but securely packaged and the ingredient list was blissfully devoid of anything I couldn't immediately recognize as food. That first night, we dined on roasted carrot bisque. That night, we officially became regular Soupies.\nSince then, we've ordered any number of delicious dishes. The leek and Swiss chard quiche was lusciously creamy and had a nice buttery crust that withstood reheating nicely. We enjoyed this crazy Tuscan Polenta Soup that was thick and hardy and brightened up by spicy chunks of homemade sausage. Another favorite was the Shrimp Maque Choux \u2013 chunky and vegetable-laden, we served this with rice and made a meal for two twice. The menu changes weekly, and the website is equipped with a rating system so you can see which menu items customers have enjoyed in the past.\nRecently, we opted for the seafood gumbo, and it is officially my favorite soup to date. The flavor was incredible \u2013 deep and complex, but not overpowering. And the seafood \u2013 I can't overstate this \u2013 it was perfectly cooked. Every water creature in the gumbo: shrimp, crawfish, oysters, fish \u2013 all of it was meltingly tender. I loved it so much, there might have been tears when we finished it off.\nLet's say you're outside the delivery area. Heck, let's further say you're beyond driving distance. You can still get a dose of the Soup Peddler. Several years ago now, David Ansel wrote a book: The Soup Peddler's Slow and Difficult Soups: Recipes and Reveries. It's part cookbook, part narrative, and I have read the silly thing cover to cover at least twice over the years. (Come to think of it, I ought to read it again now as a motivational text, since I quit my job a seemingly very long time ago and still haven't come up with a good grown-up plan for myself.)\nSlow and Difficult Soups follows David through his second season as The Soup Peddler, his diverse and delicious seasonal soup recipes marking his course through the year. While his sense of humor and excellent prose make this a fun read throughout, one of my favorite bits comes early on. In the introduction, we get a bit of background. Ansel is a degreed electrical engineer, and it was a software job that brought him to Austin. Walking away from that job opened the way for Ansel to eventually find his path as The Soup Peddler ... \u201cThen I uttered the seven words that changed my life. 'I think I quit.' I paused thoughtfully and drew the middle of my bottom lip up. 'Yeah, I quit.'\u201d\nToday David runs a successful right-sized business that employs a handful of people and delivers, as he says, \u201cthe most lovingly made food in town.\u201d I can't personally vouch for that, but I can say the food we've received is as good as homemade \u2013 both in recognizability of ingredients and quality of finished product, and offers me the occasional night off cooking \u2013 which, believe it or not, even I enjoy.\n\u00bb Trackbacks & Pingbacks", "label": 1}

Middle management you can train somebody to do. You can train somebody to establish a schedule, and this is your routine. This is what your agents need to produce, and you need to manage them that everybody does 200 transactions a month, keep your computers running, open on time, close on time.\nThat can be taught. Decision-making is a lot harder. You have to empower people to make decisions and not get too hard on them if they make a mistake.

{"text": "The financial crisis of 2008 has prompted many commentators to claim that we are about to enter another Great Depression. Yes, we are entering a serious slump\u2014 one that will probably last until late 2009 or early 2010. That said, the current slump is not (and will not be) comparable to the Great Depression of 1929-1933. Before they manufacture a greater crisis, the chattering classes should stop scaring the public and check the facts. Unlike the current crisis, the Great Depression was \u201cgreat.\u201d The money supply in the United States, measured by currency, plus demand deposits (M1), dropped by 25% (see Table 1). And not surprisingly, a sharp deflation occurred, with all major price indices registering significant declines (see Table 2).\nNational income in the United States was cut by more than half (53.5%). Unemployment rose from 3.1% in 1929 to 24.7% in 1933, with manufacturing accounting for the largest decline in employment\u2014falling from 21.6% of the labor force in 1929 to 14.3% in 1933. Trade (exports, plus imports), as a portion of the gross national product, collapsed and didn\u2019t regain its pre-Great Depression levels until the early 1970s. Economic prospects were so dismal in the U.S. that more people were emigrating than immigrating\u2014a very abnormal occurrence.\nOne of the most significant features of the Great Depression was the collapse of private domestic investment. On a gross basis, it fell from 19.6% of GNP in 1929 to 4.4% in 1933\u2014thanks, in part, to a dramatic drop in business inventories. By 1932, net private domestic investment was negative, indicating that the economy\u2019s capital stock was shrinking.\nProfits are the reward of the active capitalists\u2014the entrepreneurs. In contrast, interest is the reward of the passive capitalists. The impact of inflation and deflation on the distribution of income to these two types of capitalists is noteworthy. Profits are derived from purchasing something at a particular time and selling it later at a higher price. When all prices are rising, this is relatively easy to do; when all prices are falling, it\u2019s very difficult. Accordingly, deflation shifts income from profits to interest. The surge in the portion of national income going to \u201cnet interest\u201d (from 5.6% in 1929 to 10.4% in 1933) and the decline in the portion going to profits (from 11.3% in 1929 to -3.8% in 1933) was as unsurprising as it was catastrophic (see Table 1).\nThe Great Depression was one of the most extraordinary episodes in U.S. economic history, if not the entire capitalist world. To compare the current crisis to the Great Depression is stretching the facts beyond the breaking point.\nTable One\nMoney Supply and National Income by Type, 1929-1933\nTable Two\nPrice Indices, 1929-1933\nAnd that\u2019s not all. The purveyors of Great Depression myths\u2014such as this year\u2019s Nobel laureate in Economics Paul Krugman\u2014assert that the fiscal stimulus which accompanied World War II rescued the economy from the Great Depression. In fact, the Great Depression was followed by a spontaneous recovery, with the unemployment rate falling from 24.7% in 1933 to 14.2% in 1937. This recovery was interrupted by a sharp slump in 1938-1939. It was concentrated in the manufacturing sector and was associated with a decline in gross private domestic investment.\nEven though a spontaneous recovery occurred before World War II, it is important to stress that scholarship by Robert Higgs, and other economic historians, shows that\u2014contrary to legend\u2014the New Deal held down the spontaneous recovery and contributed to the 1938-1939 slump. Indeed, Higgs\u2019 evidence demonstrates that investment was depressed by New Deal initiatives because of regime uncertainty\u2014\u201da pervasive uncertainty among investors about the security of their property rights in their capital and prospective returns.\u201d (Robert Higgs, Depression, War and Cold War: Studies in Political Economy. New York: Oxford University Press, 2006, p.5). In short, investors were afraid to commit funds to new projects because they didn\u2019t know what President Roosevelt and the New Dealers will do next.\nThis brings us to the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). This $700 billion bailout program is, among other things, a bureaucratic nightmare that is as confused as it is confusing. Add to that Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson\u2019s major shifts in the TARP\u2019s direction, as well as the circus on Capitol Hill, and we have all the ingredients for a royal case of regime uncertainty. It shouldn\u2019t be surprising, therefore, that each time Secretary Paulson makes a pronouncement or the Congress performs another act, the stock market takes a dive.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Find pleasure in diversity of life\nGoing Nature's Way\nOne of the most famous trees in New Zealand, the Kauri, is similar to our redwoods in size and age.\nI have to admit that I\u2019m glad for the convenience and connectivity of the internet because it is allowing me to see and hear about the beautiful autumn weather (so far) at home, while we experience the beautiful spring weather in New Zealand. It also allows me to easily share some of my observations of this island nation in the Pacific Ocean.\nMy husband, Mike, chose this season to come here because he knew it would mean lots of flowers and birds. He was right. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t think about the possibility of spring allergies that would accompany all this profuse flowering. With some meds from the local \"chemist\" shop, we will carry on.\nWe are reminded that we are on the other half of the world when we look at our clock (on the computer) and it says 2 a.m. as we are eating our dinner. As I write this, it is noon on October 2 on the North Island, while it\u2019s 5 p.m. on October 1 in Minnesota \u2014 hard for the mind to comprehend.\nWe have been staying at a house on Cooper\u2019s Beach, which is part of Doubtless Bay, on the northeast coast of the North Island. In front of this house is the Pacific Ocean, but I have to tell you, it looks a lot like Lake Superior on a day with a strong northeasterly wind kicking up waves on a gray surface. When the sun comes out though, the water turns a turquoise not normally seen in the Great Lakes.\nAs an island nation, New Zealand has been impacted by outside forces for the past six centuries, when people first arrived on its shores. Up until that time, the plants, animals and birds lived in balance and evolved to match the climate and geology of this volcanic land. There are only two native mammals \u2014 both bats. Every other mammal that exists here today was introduced by people. Like Hawaii, these introduced species have had an incredibly detrimental impact on the local flora and fauna. We came to this country knowing that history, but also knowing there is much to delight a North American naturalist\u2019s heart in the plants and birds that live here.\nEven though the climate is considered temperate and not tropical, the forests look like jungles to us. The most famous tree is the Kauri. It is also one of the most endangered. Similar to our redwoods in size and age, the Kauri is a conifer, but it has leaves, rather than needles. Straight trunks could reach up to 180 feet and measure 18 feet in diameter, highly desirable to the European settlers for ship\u2019s masts and building timbers. Very few Kauri remain today, three quarters of which are found on the North Island.\nWe spent some time walking through a Kauri Reserve this week and it was humbling to realize that some of these living giants could be more than a thousand years old. The vegetation surrounding the trees was so thick we couldn\u2019t begin to imagine how a human would get through it, without much swinging of a machete.\nThe other plant form New Zealand is known for are ferns (more than 80 species), including tree ferns. Yes, they take the form of trees, some reaching 60\u2019 feet in height. When you look at these prehistoric plants lining the sides of the road, you wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see a velociraptor poking its head through the fronds.\nMike loves geology and thought he knew everything about basalt, which is created from volcanic eruptions. Some of the North Shore on Lake Superior is made of the same rock. Basalt is not supposed to erode. That is the understanding among geologists, but there is an exception here on this island. We visited a placed called Wairere Boulders, famous because it has basalt formations unlike anywhere else in the world. Here the black rocks have ridges and flutes. What caused this unheard of and supposedly impossible feature? The leaves of Kauri trees! Yes, these leaves contain an acid that can eat through rock. Sometimes you have to go to the other side of the world to learn something new.\nWe are very fortunate to have been able to come to this far away land, and all the exotic nature it includes, but when we are in our own country we find surprises and delights await us in other states. The most important component to travel is to be open to new discoveries and ways of interpreting the world we live in. For us, the incredible diversity of life that exists on this planet is a never ending source of pleasure and wonder.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Today the BBC announced that Steven Moffat, writer of several brilliant episodes in the time-traveling adventure show Doctor Who, will take over as showrunner next year for the fifth season of the network's rebooted series. Like current showrunner Russell T. Davies, Moffat has been a fan of Doctor Who since he was young. He told reporters, \"My entire career has been a secret plan to get this job. I applied before but I got knocked back because the BBC wanted someone else. Also I was seven.\" Many Doctor Who fans have been worried about the fate of the show as Davies steps down.\nDavies, best known before Doctor Who for creating the show Queer as Folk, has become something of a legend among fans for rebooting a show it was thought might never return. Though the show had been on the air pretty much continuously since the early 1960s, it ground to a halt in the late 80s. After over a decade on hiatus, punctuated by one 1990s movie and a lot of great audio plays, Doctor Who finally returned to life when Davies reimagined the doctor as a more modern, dangerous, and sexy character. Taking his cues from the witty-scary style of shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Davies truly managed to reinvent Who for a new generation, garnering top ratings for the show, which currently plays all over the world.\nSteven Moffat's writing on the new Doctor Who has been part of what has made the show so compelling. He's worked on some of the most memorable stories like \"The Empty Child\" (which introduced the character of Captain Jack, who later got his own show, Torchwood), and the much-awarded \"Blink,\" about some seriously creepy aliens who only move when you aren't looking at them. He also wrote the awesome BBC miniseries Jekyll last year. So you can count on Doctor Who's fifth season to have a lot of horror in it.\nDavies will be working on four Doctor Who specials in 2009, but Moffat will be running the show proper. There have been rumors that the current Doctor, the fauxhawked, goofy-adorable David Tennant, may leave after this season but they have not been confirmed. If true, it could mean Doctor Who's fifth season will start with a clean slate: new showrunner, new actor in the role of Doctor.\nSteven Moffat to replace Russell T. Davies [Guardian]", "label": 1}
{"text": "What you need to know\nQuit Victoria defines second-hand smoke as being made up of \u2018mainstream\u2019 smoke, which the smoker breathes out, and \u2018sidestream\u2019 smoke, which drifts from the end of a burning cigarette.\nChildren most commonly come into contact with second-hand smoke when their parents, family and friends smoke.\nBut the problem isn\u2019t just smoking around children \u2013 second-hand smoke hangs around for up to five hours. It gets left on furniture, carpets and clothing. This means babies and children are still exposed to it even after adults have finished their cigarettes.\nInfants and children are particularly at risk from second-hand smoke because they have smaller airways and less mature immune systems. Their smaller airways mean they breathe faster, so they breathe in relatively more second-hand smoke \u2013 and its harmful chemicals \u2013 than an adult would in the same amount of time.\nHealth risks linked with passive smoking\nPassive smoking dramatically increases health risks for babies, children and teenagers. Studies show that children exposed to second-hand smoke are at an increased risk of premature death and disease and are more likely to have thickening, irritation and inflammation of their airways.\nSecond-hand smoke can impair a baby\u2019s breathing and heart rate, which can put them at a higher risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). If parents smoke during pregnancy and after their baby is born, their baby\u2019s SIDS risk increases. If one parent smokes, the risk of SIDS doubles. If both parents smoke, the risk doubles again.\nIf children are exposed to second-hand smoke, they\u2019re more likely to develop a range of lung and other health problems, including:\nThere\u2019s also evidence that exposure to second-hand smoke can increase the likelihood of behaviour problems and learning difficulties.\nIf children live in a household where one or more adults smoke, they\u2019re exposed to greater health risks. They need to go to the doctor more often. The chance that they will take up smoking in adolescence doubles.\nProtecting your child from second-hand smoke\nThe most important way to protect your child from second-hand smoke is to quit smoking. This greatly reduces your child\u2019s exposure to second-hand smoke. It also gives your child a positive non-smoking role model.\nIf you\u2019re not quite ready to quit, or someone else in your home is the one smoking, there are still things you can do to reduce your child\u2019s exposure to the smoke. One of the most important things you can do is to make sure no-one smokes in front of your child. This means you\u2019ll have to do it away from your child, and that you\u2019ll need to ask other family members, friends and visitors to do the same. Explain to them that simply blowing smoke away from your child doesn\u2019t protect him from the harmful effects of smoke. Also make sure you never smoke in an enclosed area near your child.\nWhen visiting friends, or leaving children in the care of someone else, try to make sure the environment is smoke-free.\nNever smoke in a car that carries children. Opening the car window isn\u2019t enough to stop smoke affecting children. In most Australian states, it\u2019s illegal to smoke in a car that carries a child under the age of 18. This legislation is backed by the evidence that second-hand smoke is particularly harmful to children. Hefty on-the-spot fines are enforced if you\u2019re caught smoking in a car that carries children.\nMake a commitment that your home and car will be smoke-free at all times. Insist that no-one smokes around your child. Every child has the right to grow up in a smoke-free environment.\nSeek help\nIf you need more advice about quitting smoking or the effects that second-hand smoke has on your child, there are services, support and resources available. You can start by talking to your GP, another health professional, or by calling Quitline on 131 848.\nSecond-hand smoke and SIDS\nThis video is available in different languages\nStrong evidence shows that exposure to smoke harms babies, and that smoking during pregnancy and after birth increases the risk of SIDS. The link between SIDS and smoking is strong even when parents smoke away from their baby.\nThis video explains that one important precaution you can take against SIDS is keeping the smokes outside and away from your baby all the time, not just when baby\u2019s sleeping. The video also includes tips on safe sleeping, sleeping baby on back, sleeping baby at the end of the cot, avoiding a flat head and sleeping arrangements.\nYou might also like to check out our illustrated guide to preventing SIDS.", "label": 1}
{"text": "West Palm Beach, Fla (PRWEB) February 08, 2013\nNewsmax is pleased to announce the release of its latest interview with New York Times best-selling author Robert (Bob) Wiedemer, titled Aftershock Awakening.\nThe original Aftershock interview, released in 2009, has now been viewed over 50 million times by Americans concerned about the stability of our country\u2019s economy and financial system.\nDespite being banned by a major online media outlet, the original Aftershock video quickly spread through social media, at one point gathering over 140,000 \u201clikes\u201d on Facebook, and in its wake, numerous financial outlets such as CNBC, Fox Business, and Reuters turned to Wiedemer for unfiltered insight into our country\u2019s economic and financial troubles.\nIn Aftershock Awakening, Wiedemer builds on the success of the original interview, but takes an unprecedented step: He includes the testimonials of average, everyday Americans and shows how their lives were transformed emotionally, financially, and economically by watching Aftershock.\nAftershock Awakening highlights the success of these six hardworking and honest Americans. Viewers hear from Kerri Satterlee, whose family-owned jewelry stores nearly went out of business after decades in her community because of the devastating recession. Her family went months without a paycheck as Satterlee, determined to pay her employees and keep their jobs, personally struggled to make ends meet. After viewing Aftershock, Satterlee made a drastic change to her business, and her monthly income is now double what it was a year ago.\nBeckett Cantley, a successful tax professional from Georgia, was facing bankruptcy due to losing nearly $1.5 million in real estate. Since viewing Aftershock, Cantley has drastically transformed his investment portfolio and real estate holdings, and he and his family are \u201cnow in a financial place where we are comfortable.\u201d\nAnd Barbara Brandau, a housewife from Minnesota, was the most affected by what she saw in Aftershock. \u201cWe were very close to retirement when the stock market tumbled. I was panicked. I was fearful. I was frightened. It was a terrible day in our life looking forward to the future and how we were going to survive it.\u201d Since watching Aftershock, Barbara\u2019s situation has improved, and she was able to retire recently. \u201cI\u2019m not really fearful anymore. I understand what could happen and I feel that I am prepared this time to react to what could happen and to react before it all falls apart. So, because of Aftershock, my days of anxiety are really not there anymore.\u201d\nIn Aftershock Awakening, Wiedemer not only warns of mounting federal debts, an increase in our money supply, and a falling dollar, but he also provides viewers with a six-step investment blueprint to thrive when the dollar and debt bubbles burst.\n\u201cThese testimonials are why we dedicate all the time and money to spread Bob\u2019s message.\nThe original interview changed peoples\u2019 lives, and we want to make sure that everyone can view Aftershock Awakening,\u201d said Aaron DeHoog, the financial publisher at Newsmax.\nThe Aftershock Awakening interview can be viewed at http://www.AftershockAwakening.com, courtesy of Newsmax.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Arsenal through despite loss to Napoli\nGonzalo Higuain's goal helped give Napoli a 2-0 win over 10-man Arsenal, but the Gunners progressed following a late victory for Borussia Dortmund at Marseille.\nArsenal needed a point to be sure of seeding for the knockout stage, but will now likely face one of Europe's leading sides such as Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Real Madrid or Paris St Germain in Monday's draw.\nHiguain, who was a summer transfer target for Arsenal, slotted home on 73 minutes to finally break Arsenal's determined resistance and after Mikel Arteta was shown a second yellow card, it was always going to be an uphill battle to get back into the tie.\nJose Callejon chipped in a second during stoppage-time, but it was not enough and Rafa Benitez's men must now regroup for the Europa League.\nNapoli started brightly, cheered on by their ferocious support at the Stadio Sao Paulo, with Goran Pandev forcing an early save from Wojciech Szczesny.\nArsenal, though, should have gone ahead on 23 minutes but club-record signing Mesut Ozil completely missed his kick after the ball dropped to him inside the Napoli penalty area following a fierce drive by Olivier Giroud.\nNapoli skipper Cristian Maggio clipped an angled shot over the bar as Szczesny raced out of his area and, as half-time approached, the Poland stopper saw his clearance bounce off Gonzalo Higuain's head and drop just past the post.\nNapoli had to up their game in the second half and left-back Pablo Armero blasted straight at the Arsenal keeper when played into the penalty area on 57 minutes.\nTwo Greenpeace protesters then abseiled down from the roof to unveil a protest banner before the Italians finally went in front when Higuain - a summer transfer target for Arsenal - turned inside the right side of the penalty area and drove a low shot into the corner of the net.\nThe Gunners were then reduced to 10 men when Mikel Arteta fouled Callejon, which Hungary referee Viktor Kassai deemed enough for a second yellow card.\nCallejon clipped in a late second as Arsenal went through in runners-up spot on head-to-head record compared to the Germans.\nArsenal were aiming to reach the Champions League knockout stage for the 14th successive season and manager Wenger elected to start with Jack Wilshere, Theo Walcott and Aaron Ramsey all on the bench.\nThe Barclays Premier League club had warned supporters to take extra care in and around the city following previous problems with Napoli's 'Ultra' hardcores.\nAlthough special buses had been laid on to take the travelling fans out to the stadium, many were delayed resulting in several hundred missing kick-off, with additional problems caused by late congestion outside the entrance gate.\nOn the pitch, Napoli produced their expected positive start, with an early goal for qualification rivals Dortmund in Marseille putting extra pressure on Benitez's men.\nGoran Pandev got away down the left and his angled shot was held by Szczesny.\nIt then needed a solid block from German centre-half Per Mertesacker after left-back Pablo Armero had broken quickly on the counter-attack.\nArsenal's big chance came on 23 minutes when Ozil fed Mathieu Flamini, recalled to the starting XI, who in turn played a delightful pass over to Giroud on the left.\nThe France forward cut inside and drove the ball goalwards, which Rafael Cabral - replacing the unfit Pepe Reina for a Champions League debut - parried and it dropped right into the path of Ozil, only for the German to lose his footing just as he shaped to shoot.\nNapoli forward Jose Callejon curled a 25-yard shot over the crossbar but Arsenal largely continued to frustrate the Italians, which was half the battle as the home support grew edgy - with Mikel Arteta and Flamini doing a good job of breaking up play in central midfield.\nHowever, there was a let-off for the Gunners on 37 minutes when full-back Maggio got clear down the right and Szczesny came racing out to the edge of the penalty area. The chip from the Napoli captain, though, floated over the crossbar.\nThe Poland keeper was then almost embarrassed when his clearance bounced off the head of Higuain - a summer transfer target for Arsenal - and just wide.\nArsenal were more positive at the start of the second half as they looked to close in on the positive result needed to top the group, with Ozil firing wide from 20 yards after being set up by Santi Cazorla.\nAs the hour approached, Napoli needed to find something soon and should have when Armero skipped into the penalty area, but his tame shot was straight at the keeper from point-blank range.\nCallejon then dragged a shot across goal and wide from the right - much to the disapproval of the home support.\nWith 25 minutes left, Cazorla was replaced by Ramsey, whose goal in Dortmund last month had set Arsenal back on course for the knockout stage.\nTwo Greenpeace protesters then abseiled down from the roof to unveil a protest banner.\nBack on the pitch, Napoli swept in front after 73 minutes when Higuain was given time to turn in the Arsenal box and fire a low shot past Szczesny.\nThe visitors had to play the final 14 minutes with 10 men after Arteta collected what looked a somewhat harsh second caution for fouling Callejon.\nFrom then on it it was always going to be damage limitation, but the news of the late goal for Dortmund to win in Marseille dampened the atmosphere before Callejon stroked home a second in stoppage time.", "label": 1}
{"text": "4th Quarter 2011 Commentary - ASTON/Montag & Caldwell Growth Fund\n4th Quarter 2011\nAfter dropping double-digits during the third quarter, U.S. equity markets recovered nicely during the final quarter of the year, with both the broad-market S&P 500 Index and the Fund\u2019s Russell 1000 Growth Index benchmark rallying more than 10%. After a sluggish first half of 2011, economic growth increased at a healthier rate during the second half of the year. A pick-up in consumer spending and ongoing solid gains in business investment contributed to third quarter economic growth, while fourth quarter real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) benefited from improved inventory and trade trends, along with continued gains in consumer spending.\nAlthough the Eurozone debt crisis and the likelihood that Europe has entered a recession increase the risk to economic growth here in the U.S., we believe 2% GDP growth can be achieved in 2012. Job and income growth should be sufficient to support a moderate increase in consumer spending, but no more than that, as consumer debt levels remain high and personal savings rates are low. Business investment should experience another increase in 2012, supported by record levels of corporate profitability and some rebuilding of business inventories from 2011 levels. In addition, both housing starts and unit sales of autos and light trucks could show moderate improvement from depressed levels.\nStill, the developed world simply has too much debt, and it will require time, patience, and sound fiscal policies to adequately reduce it in order to establish a solid foundation so that historical trend-line growth of closer to 3% can once again be achieved.\nUp Year, Lagging Quarter\nThe Fund modestly underperformed the benchmark during the fourth quarter, but outgained the index for the full year 2011 amid an environment of heightened volatility and unexpected global developments. An overweight allocation to Consumer Staples and underweight position in Energy, which positively contributed to relative results for the year, were among the main causes for lagging the index during the quarter. With the exception of Kraft, stock selection also lagged within the Consumer Staples, further detracting from relative returns during the fourth quarter.\nUnderweight positions in the surging Materials and Industrial sectors, an overweight to Healthcare, and cash also detracted from performance during the quarter. The Fund continues to hold a cash reserve, which served as a drag on returns amid a strong market rally, due to weak economic data and the limited availability of additional monetary and fiscal stimulus.\nNotable detractors among individual holdings included Oracle, Monsanto, and Bed Bath & Beyond. Oracle reported disappointing results, with earnings per share uncharacteristically missing consensus estimates by three cents. Results fell short across all products and geographies, leading us to trim the portfolio\u2019s position. Monsanto was relatively weak within Materials even with higher inventories than forecasted, as corn stocks remain at multi-decade lows. With a less aggressive pricing strategy and several product cycles unfolding, we think the company seems poised to deliver strong volume/share gains even with modestly lower corn prices. Thus, we added to the position during the quarter. Bed Bath & Beyond disappointed some analysts\u2019 high expectations for same store sales in its fiscal third quarter earnings report, despite upside in its earnings. We viewed the quarter favorably, with a healthy same-store sales increase on top of a series of strong numbers. We believe the company will be one of the faster growers among large-cap retailers and a long-term market share gain story, leading us to add to the position.\nOverall stock selection in the Technology, Consumer Discretionary, and Energy sectors contributed positively to relative results for the quarter. Google, Visa, and Qualcomm within Technology all rose more than the sector. McDonald\u2019s and Omnicom Group shined within Consumer Discretionary, with McDonald\u2019s being reduced as the stock neared its all-time high and approached 5% of Fund assets. Omnicom was also eventually trimmed as about a third of its revenue comes from outside the U.S., which may be negatively affected by the European debt crisis.\nEnergy was the best performing sector in the index during the quarter. Although the Fund\u2019s underweight position detracted overall from relative performance, stock selection within the sector outperformed. Among other individual stocks of note, pharmacy benefit manager Medco Health Solutions rose strongly. We increased the Fund\u2019s position after the company reported earnings that exceeded expectations. We think the company should benefit from the announced merger with Express Scripts, which is expected to close during the first half of 2012.\nBuys and Sells\nThree new positions were added to the portfolio during the quarter\u2014Cisco Systems, General Electric, and Unilever. Networking firm Cisco has become more streamlined and focused, with its restructuring program expected to generate approximately $1 billion in annual cost savings. We think strong free cash-flow and ample cash on its balance sheet can lead to higher dividends and increased share repurchases. The company is ideally positioned to benefit from continued growth in IP data traffic fueled by mobile, video and cloud technology.\nWe viewed diversified industrial manufacturer and service company General Electric as attractively valued given its nearly 4% dividend yield and leverage to late-cycle industries. In addition, we think conditions have improved at financial arm GE Capital. Unilever is a leading global consumer products company with a long tenure in Emerging Markets, faster growing regions that are now the source of 55% of the firm\u2019s revenues. We think solid organic growth and a focus on improving operating margins could help the company to generate consistent double-digit earnings growth.\nThe position in JP Morgan, the Fund\u2019s only Financials holding, was eliminated during the period. Although we had increased the position early in the quarter as the stock approached trough valuation levels from market lows in 1998, 2001 and 2008, we subsequently reduced and ultimately exited the position given its lack of relative earnings momentum.\nOther noteworthy portfolio changes included the trimming of some Industrials and Technology names. Emerson Electric was reduced after the company reduced fiscal first quarter earnings guidance due to weaker than expected sales in its Network Power and Climate divisions. Fluor was trimmed after the stock rebounded nicely from recent lows and our concern about slowing economic growth. Within Technology, we eventually cut back on Accenture late in the quarter after having added to it earlier. A shift towards outsourcing versus consulting suggests to us entry into the later stages of the information technology services cycle. Finally, Apple was trimmed following the company\u2019s uncharacteristic earnings miss. We believed upside was limited in the near-term as investors evaluated the competitive environment for the iPhone and iPad.\nWe expect a challenging and volatile stock market environment into the middle of 2012. With the U.S. economy expected to show very moderate growth, the European economy poised to enter a recession, and Emerging Market economies downshifting to reduced, but still above-average, rates of growth, global growth is slowing. Given this global slowdown and with corporate profitability already at record levels, investors are likely to be disappointed to find that corporate profit expectations for both the intermediate- and longer-term periods are generally too high. In addition to slowing economic and profit growth, investors will also have to contend with significant political uncertainty until U.S. voters determine which candidates can best solve our budget deficit, slower growth, and high unemployment problems. Clarity on these issues is unlikely until the middle of this year.\nIn our view, we are in the early stages of a rotation to higher-quality growth stocks such as those held in the Fund. In the challenging market environment that we expect in the months ahead, we believe these stocks may do particularly well as their valuations are attractive and their earnings growth is more assured. Longer-term, due to their financial strength and global diversification, we think these companies are positioned to provide sustained growth, and in many cases offer very attractive dividend yields in an environment where both growth and income yield will be scarce.\nMontag & Caldwell Investment Counsel\nAs of December 31, 2011, Kraft Foods comprised 4.46% of the portfolio's assets, Oracle \u2013 1.38%, Monsanto \u2013 2.43%, Bed Bath & Beyond \u2013 2.53%, Google \u2013 4.73%, Visa \u2013 2.94%, Qualcomm \u2013 3.91%, McDonald\u2019s \u2013 4.21%, Omnicom Group \u2013 2.11%, Medco Health Solutions \u2013 2.52%, Cisco Systems \u2013 1.89%, General Electric \u2013 1.63%, Unilever \u2013 1.30%, Emerson Electric \u2013 1.42%, Fluor \u2013 1.32%, Accenture \u2013 2.45%, and Apple \u2013 4.06", "label": 1}

Skinsheen Leg Spray in Medium Dark\n- Moisturize and use primer to prep your skin for makeup. Using a foundation brush apply your foundation from the center of your face, blending downward and outward. Apply concealer with a concealer brush over and under the eyes and wherever additional coverage is needed. This look focuses on flawless and radiant skin, spend a little more time perfecting your complexion.\n- Smile to find the round, fleshy, apple of your cheeks and apply your cr\u00e8me blush, blending softly up into the hairline and a bit lower than the apple for a natural flush. Using a large fluffy brush, set your foundation, concealer, and cr\u00e8me blush completely with pressed powder. Using a powder brush, lightly apply bronzer everywhere the sun would hit you naturally. Blend it over your temple, cheekbones, and chin in a 3 shape alongside your face. Blend it over your forehead, nose, and neck as well to add some warmth. To sculpt and slim your face, apply the brown powder directly under your cheekbones to contour, blending softly into the foundation and powder. You don\u2019t want any harsh obvious lines or stripes, be sure to blend everything together. Using a synthetic bristle eye shadow or concealer brush, apply M.A.C. Pigment in Naked to the tops of your cheekbones to highlight, blending into a backward C shape from the outer edge of your eye to your cheekbone. This subtle shimmer will catch the light and sculpt your cheekbones beautifully.\n- This look is really all about the eyeliner and emulating Marilyn Monroe\u2019s signature cat eye. Using a synthetic bristle eye shadow brush, apply M.A.C. Paint in Bare Canvas all over the eye from lash line to brow bone. Using the same synthetic bristle brush, apply Naked pigment all over the lid up to the brow bone for a subtle radiance.\n- Using a white eye pencil, draw a thin line on the waterline (read: inner rim) of the lower lashes. This simple trick will help make the whites of your eyes appear larger and brighter, an essential step in the Victoria\u2019s Secret Angels look.\n- Using M.A.C. Penultimate Eye Liner, and a steady hand, apply a thin line to the upper lashes. Work tight against the lash line, beginning at the middle of the eye. Wherever you put the applicator down first is where you will deposit the most color and product. After you make your line or \u2014dash\u2014in the middle, extend the line to the outer edge of your eye and kick it up at the outer corner for a cat eye, winged effect. If you mess up simply take a Q-tip moistened with water to remove and start again. It takes patience and practice, but you\u2019ll get there. Whatever is left on the applicator you want to use to line the inner corner and finish connecting the eye liner. Once you have achieved the line and shape you want, you can go back over the line and thicken or straighten it as needed. If it gets too thick, again you can use the wet Q-tip to fix it. You want the most concentration of color and product to be on the outer edge and corner of the eye. You really want to deposit the product at the base of the lashes, making the lashes look thick and lush and further defining the eye.\n- Curl your lashes with the Shu Uemura eyelash curler. Get as far back to the eyelid as possible (without pinching!) and pump the curler for ten seconds to really lock in the curl. Apply your volumizing black mascara to the upper and lower lashes, getting as far back to the root of the lashes as possible for a thick, rich look. Apply multiple coats until you achieve the desired look. The models did not wear false eyelashes for the 2011 show, so making the most of your natural lashes with liner and mascara is imperative.\n- Use a synthetic bristle angle brush to lightly fill in your brows with M.A.C. eye shadow in Omega. Use short, upward strokes- you\u2019re creating a shadow effect, the illusion that there is slightly more hair.\n- Apply a coat of Freckletone Lipstick and top it off with a layer of Orange Tempera gloss for added color and shine.\n- Radiant and supple skin is essential in achieving the Victoria\u2019s Secret Angels look. Moisturize your exposed skin and perfect any flaws or discoloration with M.A.C. Face and Body Makeup.\n- To add dimension and a light coat of golden color, lightly apply M.A.C. Skinsheen Leg Spray down the center of your arms and legs and over your collarbones to add a slenderizing highlight and complete your Victoria\u2019s Secret Angel look.\nThis year\u2019s Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show featured a more natural look when it came to makeup. No false lashes and no spray tans were used to get the Angels runway ready. Do you like the more natural look? Or are you all about the false lashes and spray tans?\nDid you tune in to watch the Victoria\u2019s Secret 2011 Fashion Show?\nHave a fantastic weekend!\n*Images from Zimbio, US Magazine, and\nGreat great post Bre!

{"text": "Oral Testimony of Henri Ader,\nPresident of the Ethics Committees of the Paris Bar and the General Council of French Bars,\nbefore the ABA Commission on Multidisciplinary Practice\nAugust 8, 1999\nThe next person at the microphone was Henri Ader, former chair of the Paris Bar, and president of the ethics committees of the Paris Bar and the General Council of French Bars, and vice-president of the ethics committee of the Federation of European Bars. He indicated he had read the Commission\u2019s report as well as the MDP reports of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York and the New York State Bar. He likened the English \u2018core values of the legal profession\u2019 to the French \u2018principes essentiel\u2019 and said these are main principles on which all lawyers in France agree. He identified four essential principles: independence, avoidance of conflicts of interest, professional secrecy, and client\u2019s free choice of the lawyer. The Nallet Report, commissioned by the French Prime Minister and issued in July 1999, calls, in addition to the normal bar organization, for the creation of a national commission having jurisdiction over matters of professional ethics involving MDPs where there are gaps or conflicts in the rules applicable to the professions in the MDP. It would consist of members of the government as well as representatives of bar and accounting organizations (eight in all). The avocats, however, oppose the Report because they want to remain masters of their own yard. His understanding of the Report is that any MDP partner of a lawyer must observe the four essential principles or the lawyers must leave the MDP.\nAsked by the Chair whether the European accounting community has responded to the French proposal that applies the four principles, including conflict of interest and its imputation rule, to an MDP, Mr. Ader responded that the accounting firms said they would respect the principles. He questioned, however, the ability of the accounting firms that have an obligation to denounce what they know to the state, to partner with a lawyer.", "label": 1}

{"text": "UK tax payers urged to take advantage of stocks and shares ISAs\nSavings and investment specialist Fair Investment Company is urging the 90 per cent of taxpayers who don't already make the most of their full \u00a310,200 tax-efficient ISA allowance to do so before it's too late.\n\"While almost 40 per cent of taxpayers have a cash ISA, less than 10 per cent have a stocks and shares ISA, and considering you can only use up to half of your full \u00a310,200 allowance in a cash ISA but can invest the whole amount in stocks and shares, UK savers are 'wasting' a great deal of money on potentially unnecessary tax payments,\" explains Julie Smith, savings analyst at Fair Investment Company. \"It's great that 40 per cent of people are using their cash allowance, but to take full advantage of ISAs, they should be looking at using the stocks and shares portion too.\"\nMost people don't invest into a stocks and shares ISA, and, says Julie, there are various reasons for this: \"some people can't afford to invest \u00a310,200 a year, for others, stocks and shares investment is simply not suitable - but, even those that do invest into stocks and shares ISAs are not using their full allowance.\"\nThe average amount invested into a stocks and shares ISA in 2009/10 was just \u00a34,155, which was only 58 per cent of the previous allowance of \u00a37,200. For cash ISAs, the average amount invested was \u00a32,731; 76 per cent of the previous \u00a33,600 cash ISA allowance.\n\"I know it is not realistic to assume that everyone can afford to invest the full allowance - which has gone up this tax year from \u00a37,200 to \u00a310,200 - but investing in an ISA, even if it's just a small amount, should really be your first port of call when it comes to saving and investing,\" says Julie, \"because of the tax efficient status an ISA provides.\n\"When you take into account inflation, currently 4.00%, outside of an ISA, basic tax payers have to be earning 5.00% on their savings and investments just to stop the true value of their money being eroded, for higher rate tax payers it's 6.67%.\n\"Obviously this means that you need to earn above inflation within an ISA for your money to retain its value in real terms, and it is quite difficult to find cash ISAs that pay more than 4.00%. This is why I am urging people to at least consider the options available within the stocks and shares component too.\"\nAs well as some top cash ISA deals, Fair Investment Company has a wide range of investment options to choose from that are available within its stocks and shares ISA wrapper.\n\"Through Fair Investment, investors can invest their stocks and shares ISA allowance into income producing capital at risk products, like the Investec FTSE 100 Bonus Income Plan which offers a fixed annual income of 6.50% or the RBS UK Fixed Income Plan which offers a fixed annual income of 6.25%,\" says Julie.\n\"We also offer access to thousands of growth funds like the Aberdeen Emerging Markets fund, which over five years has returned 109 per cent*, although it should be remembered that past performance should not be seen as a guide to future performance, and the low cost Vanguard Emerging Markets Stock Index, a passive fund that tracks the performance of the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.\n\"There are also commodities funds, such as the Black Rock Gold and General fund which has significantly outperformed the FTSE Gold mines index over one and five years*.\"\nJulie says she is urging investors to make the most of their ISA allowances before the end of the 2010/11 tax year, because it cannot be carried across to the next tax year.\n\"Although you can transfer previous years' ISA investments at anytime, you will need to invest in the current tax year's ISA by 5 April 2011,\" she says, \"because once the deadline has passed, the tax-efficient allowance for the current year can never be used again.\"\nFor a wide range of cash and stocks and shares ISA options and ideas, visit", "label": 1}
{"text": "WEST HOLLYWOOD -- One of the world's most popular rock bands performed Wednesday at a small club on the Sunset Strip as Def Leppard played a free afternoon concert at House of Blues to a thrilled audience of about 1,000 in a special Youtube.com webcast set to broadcast today. | Photos: Def Leppard at the House of Blues\nThe British band has sold more than 100 million records and is set to tour arenas once again, yet there they were right in front of us and close enough to reach out and touch.\nIt's a rock and roll tradition, a special treat, a rite of passage for a megastar band to surprise their fans once with a scaled-down, once-in-a-career performance like this.\nAerosmith did it first in 1978 with a secret show at the legendary Starwood Club in West Hollywood, billing themselves \"Dr. J Jones & the Interns.\" Of course word got out, and the Sunset Strip was like a zoo that night, Motley Crue did the same thing in 1989 at the Whisky to promote \"Dr. Feelgood,\" and Guns N' Roses performed at this very same House of Blues in March.\nSpeaking of Guns N' Roses, next to me in the upstairs section sat Duff McKagen, and that just made the whole trip even more surreal.\nThe timing is perfect for Def Leppard after releasing new versions of \"Rock of Ages\" and \"Pour Some Sugar on Me\" this past week, plus the new \"Rock of Ages\" movie featuring Tom Cruise. The band is set to begin another arena tour -- supported by Poison and Lita Ford -- including a June 22 performance at Verizon Wireless Irvine Meadows, and then after touring across the United States and Mexico, the last stop Sept. 15 at Santa Barbara Bowl.\nDef Leppard proved in fine shape Wednesday. The bass was pounding hard -- a bit too hard maybe -- but the Brits grooved their way into the proper sound mix by the second song, \"Animal,\" and the place was going crazy.\nSinger Joe Elliot was dressed all in black, and like his mates he is still trim and strong, as is guitarist Phil Collen, who went on shirtless and still has six-pack abs. \"Hysteria,\" \"Pour Some Sugar on Me\" and \"Let it Rock\" pumped along, and of course it was way too soon when Def Leppard took its bows after about 45 minutes.\nIt was a free show for fans willing to wait on line, so everyone seemed to understand they would not be playing all of their hits.\nBut wow, it was fun while it lasted. And as always, one-armed drummer Rick Allen proved a great inspiration.\nA good way to spend an afternoon, that's for sure: A great rock performance, a nice dose of people watching, plus we all made it home in time for dinner.\nJoin the Conversation", "label": 1}
{"text": "It\u2019s somewhat rare when a horror movie can appease both horror lovers and haters. But somehow, \u201cCabin in the Woods\u201d manages to perfectly blend gore, camp and comedy in an unprecedented effort to critique and reflect upon its genre.\nThe film has every single ingredient in the stereotypical horror movie recipe one could possibly think of. But director Drew Goddard (writer on \u201cCloverfield\u201d and TV\u2019s \u201cLost\u201d), who wrote the film along with Joss Whedon (TV\u2019s \u201cDollhouse\u201d), manages to take each of these conventions, both in the diegesis of the film world and outside it, and turns them upside-down.\nIt\u2019s difficult to divulge too much of the plot without spoilers. What\u2019s necessary to know is what\u2019s in the title \u2013 a cabin in the woods is where a group of five coeds decide to go for a weekend, where inevitably, they will meet their demise. It\u2019s a story that sounds too familiar to be original, but it\u2019s anything but ordinary.\nInstead of opening the film with the group of 20-somethings, \u201cCabin in the Woods\u201d begins with two average-looking, middle-aged workers (Richard Jenkins, \u201cThe Rum Diary,\u201d and Bradley Whitford, \u201cHave a Little Faith\u201d) having a mundane conversation at a seemingly uninteresting job. Without too many narrative cues that describe the nature of their work or how the workers relate to the protagonists, the title card interrupts in a campy way, ending their conversation mid-sentence, signaling the satirical tone of the rest of the movie.\nThe audience soon discovers that these workers are in charge of engineering the deaths of the cabin vacationers. They program certain aspects of the characters\u2019 lives, leading them to make different decisions that could cost the college students their lives. And they keep a betting pool of what deadly scenario will end them. Meanwhile, the coeds must figure out the scheme or die particularly grisly deaths.\n\u201cCabin in the Woods\u201d is a critique of \u2013 but also an undeniable love letter to \u2013 almost every horror movie ever made: It\u2019s a meta hipster adventure. There are clear references to mega hits like \u201cThe Hunger Games,\u201d \u201cSaw,\u201d \u201cAlien\u201d and \u201cHostel,\u201d but the argument can be made for any movie starring zombies, werewolves or axe murderers.\nHorror movie buffs will rejoice at these references and at the mysterious and sinister company engineering the coeds\u2019 doom \u2013 which feels like a meta critique of the horror film fan watching it \u2013 not to mention a decent amount of gore to be found. And those repulsed by horror can still enjoy the film\u2019s twisted sense of humor, which is one to which past horror/comedy hybrid attempts like \u201cShaun of the Dead\u201d pale in comparison.\nIn terms of critiquing the horror genre, the film makes heavy use of the classic tilted camera angles to disorient the viewer, the poorly planned scenarios that will guarantee a gruesome death, the letterman jacket-wearing jock, the dumb blonde, the virginal girl, the idiot pothead and the nerd. But the level of control that characters possess of their own destinies is constantly toyed with, both to the characters themselves and to the audience.\nGoddard tweaks the audience further, redefining and completely subverting cues that typically would alert a viewer to danger in a scary movie like music and character tropes.\nThese subversions, matched with several other aspects of \u201cCabin in the Woods,\u201d are what makes it thrilling. While Whitford\u2019s lines aren\u2019t exactly at the caliber of the Aaron Sorkin-esque dialogue he once spoke on \u201cThe West Wing,\u201d his similarly jaded demeanor as a nefarious engineer is amusing. And when the college coeds are onscreen, whether they\u2019re playing into their stereotypes or grinding against them, the screenplay often finds a way to be funny about it.\nThe film has a few shortfalls, but it\u2019s difficult to tell whether or not the filmmakers planted them on purpose in further meta-critique of the horror movie genre. Minor plot holes slip through the cracks of the outrageousness onscreen, but with few qualms from the audience.\nThe best way to describe this creation might be a genre assessment. It\u2019s a much more powerful deconstruction of the horror movie than \u201cScream,\u201d one of its few predecessors in its attempt to both function as a scary movie while tearing the concept apart. And its ending, which comes after a series of brilliant plot twists and surprise cameos, makes it similar to what Quentin Tarantino did for badass/meta World War II movies with \u201cInglourious Basterds\u201d \u2013 \u201cCabin in the Woods\u201d can\u2019t be topped.\nFive out of five stars", "label": 1}
{"text": "Whether you think this is a \u201cdirty word\u201d or it plays a beneficial part of your everyday life, there is no one in America who should be uninformed about one of the biggest agricultural biotechnology corporations in the world. Monsanto has their hands in everything, you can\u2019t deny they are a smart business. They employ over 20,000 directly and indirectly, I\u2019d venture to say they support numerous other jobholders.\nI\u2019m a big fan of reading the book before watching the movie. Full-disclosure: I\u2019m a disgustingly die-hard Harry Potter fan, the movies were okay.. but the books? I\u2019ve been re-reading them for years. Don\u2019t judge. But back to my point- although The World According to Monsanto\u2018s research has been made into a documentary, I felt it was important to read the original work. Anyone with interest in what Monsanto is, their history, and the anti-Monsanto agenda needs to read this book.\nEven as an avid reader, I thought this was a pretty tough book. I can\u2019t tell a lie- I fell asleep a record number of times. I know that doesn\u2019t sound like a glowing review, but the material was good- it was just a little overdramatic in style. It does tell a lot about the history of Monsanto, the maker of Agent Orange, DDT, and PCB\u2019s, although it takes a very accusatory stance. In my opinion, as an agriculturalist, that\u2019s where I \u201cdo my homework\u201d. Why do people hate Monsanto? I learned a lot; Monsanto has made some questionable decisions in the past, after all, it\u2019s been around since 1901. I understand immensely more about the arguments people make about the integrity of the company.\nThe thing that the author and I will probably always disagree on is the production of GMO technology. She sees it as a threat to world health, I see it as an answer to a growing population that needs to be fed healthy, sustainable food. Americans produce more while using less, and a huge reason that is possible is because of the advances in biotechnology in products used to grow crops and livestock.\nOverall, The World According to Monsanto is extremely biased. If you\u2019re a farmer, you\u2019ll scoff at some of the statements the author makes. Parts of the book will make you want to chuck it against the wall- it\u2019s not easy reading inflammatory statements about the work you\u2019ve done for decades, on family farms dating back centuries. But read it. You\u2019ll be more informed- when someone wants to talk about Monsanto, you\u2019ll know both sides of the story. That\u2019s what makes an informed blogger, voter, writer, speaker, and just an everyday average Joe (or Jane).\nThere are titles in food production and processing literature that are known to most. Michael Pollan, Eric Schlosser, Marian Nestle- their writing has made a splash with many Americans, promoting vegan and vegetarian lifestyles.\nThe CAFO Reader includes excerpts from mutiple books, addressing customer concerns such as biological effects, financial concerns, GMO\u2019s and antibiotic use, and sustainability. Edited by Daniel Imhoff, this book gives the reader the most bang for their buck. It includes writing from all of the most widely known authors and animal rights advocates. If you\u2019re looking for a good, general resource that covers all animal markets and multiple concerns, this is it. CAFO stands for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation. While farmers see the reasoning behind animal production practices, this book looks at the concerns of those who might confuse CAFO\u2019s with \u201cfactory farms\u201c.\nMy favorite part of this book is Part Two, \u201cMyths of the CAFO\u201d. It rolls through all of the myths surrounding CAFO\u2019s and common thoughts relating to the reasons why indivduals might support animal production through CAFO\u2019s. To understand why Americans have negative views about modern animal production, this is an extremely useful chapter. But to really get fired up, read Part Three- \u201cInside the CAFO\u201d. The introduction, titled \u201cWhat the Industry Doesn\u2019t Want Us to Know\u201d leads into a section that details the perceived negative production methods. The editor believes that the industry knows and accepts myths like the one that says antibiotic use is causing health problems for Americans and resistance to human medicines. They mention that farmers only care about profit, and care little about their animals, which is the mentality and untruth that we continue to work against with this blog.\nThe book finishes with steps and processes the reader can do to work against animal production and ways to move to what they consider a more sustainable diet. While this book contains a lot of untruth and a lot of opinion pieces, it\u2019s still an interesting book and extremely important to read when learning about American concerns with food production. The one thing myself and the editor do agree on is; do your homework. Research your concerns before making decisions or advocating against or for something.\nThe holidays are a great time to read. If you follow the blog regularly, you know that it is one of my favorite hobbies. I love to read. I\u2019ve collected quite a few books in the last few years, and soon I will probably need to invest in a bigger bookcase. The interesting thing about them, is most of my books about agriculture are anti-ag. Doing my homework to learn about American concerns and questions regarding farming means listening to their side of the story. In the next few days, I am going to share a few of my favorite, or the most interesting books on my shelf.\nThe two books that closely go together have equally similar names. Hal Herzog\u2019s Some We Love, Some We Hate, Some We Eat and Melanie Joy\u2019s Why We Love Dogs, Eat Pigs, and Wear Cows are two of my favorites because of the way they make the reader really think. While they both discuss the psychology of eating and raising meat animals, they are really pretty different.\nOpening Lines: Hal Herzog\u2019s \u201cWhy is it so hard to think straight about animals?\u201d:\nHerzog looks into the wide array of relationships between animal lovers, pet lovers, and animal advocates. He tells the story of a vegetarian who knew that cows and chickens were animals, but didn\u2019t consider fish to be real animals, even though they have brains, are vertebrates, and are social. After she met her future husband, who was a hunter, she slowly reverted to a meat-eating lifestyle. Then he tells the story of a boy who decided to eat a vegetarian diet based on one of those popular pro-vegan publications you sometimes see in dirty metro stations. He even felt that keeping his pet bird in captivity was wrong. He released it into the back yard. He said \u201cI knew she wouldn\u2019t survive, that she probably starved.\u201d Yet he chose to release her for his own mental well-being. The last story Herzog tells is when he owned a baby boa constrictor and the neighbors called after hearing he was feeding it kittens. Of course this wasn\u2019t true. But he brings up a good point- with all of the kittens that are euthanized in the US each year, why wouldn\u2019t we use them to feed predatory pets like snakes and birds, rather than cremating them? I know it\u2019s an \u201coff-limit\u201d thought to most Americans. This is often because we attach warm and fuzzies to kittens- the thought of them as food is disgusting. Part of this is something called antropomorphism, humans projecting their emotions onto animals. This could be similar to a farmer looking at a cow and thinking \u201che looks really content, because I just fed him and he has shelter\u201d and someone else thinking \u201cthat cow looks very sad to be confined and probably isn\u2019t fed enough\u201d. Americans project their emotions onto animals in both rational and irrational ways. Overall this book just opens up a new line of thinking about humans thoughts relating to animals.\nOpening Lines: Melanie Joy\u2019s \u201cTo love or to eat?\u201d:\nThe first minute of the following video is the opening scenario in Joy\u2019s book:\nMelanie goes on to explain carnism. Essentially, carnism is to vegetarianism as carnivore is to herbivore as meat-eater is to plant-eater. This means that carnism is the choice to eat meat. The author doesn\u2019t consider meat to be a necessary part of the diet, so eating it is a conscience decision made by humans. This is relatable to speciesism, but is more clearly defined in terms of diet. The author has said previously, in so many words, that the reason for this is to remain inoffensive and open to the meat-eaters of the world. However\u2026 in no way is this book inoffensive to meat-eaters. Joy uses quotes from Nazi leaders and philosophers to make meat-eaters reading the book to feel guilty, ignorant, almost evil. The author bases these thoughts on what she calls \u201cThe Three N\u2019s\u201d.\nNormal: Eating meat is normal. If everyone\u2019s doing it, how can it be wrong?\nNatural: Eating animals, especially raising animals for meat, is the way things should be.\nNecessary: For 2 reasons: animal population control and health and world hunger benefits.\nJoy\u2019s combats all of these common reasons why humans, specifically Americans, eat meat. Her opinion is that all meat consumption is wrong, but her ideas are intriguing in terms of psychology. Most Americans would be disgusted with the thought of eating golden retriever, but that\u2019s just a food taboo in the US. Around the world, people eat some whack stuff. In the West African nation of Togo, rats are on the menu. In Iceland, during the holiday celebration called Thorrablot, residents dine on rams\u2019 testicles, sheep\u2019s heads, and rotting shark. Kutti pi, highly desired by most Indians and Europeans, is considered a delicacy because it is rare- animal fetus. All across the globe, we swat or spray misquitos, I would say even animal lovers: yet they have brains, they breed, they\u2019re living creatures. Where is the line drawn? This is why I love these two books: they make me think about these weird things.\nDo you eat meat? Why do you do it? I feel comfortable eating meat because there is a cycle of respect and care that I am confident occurs in animal production. I was once asked \u201chow does it feel to eat an animal you raised?\u201d This is important: I felt successful. Hear me out: if I had given that young pig anything but the best care that was possible of me, and it died or became ill, I would have failed. The fact that I cared for an animal, raised it, watched it grow, and then was informed about the slaughter process of animals is a success. I know where my food came from. There is no disconnect or unrealistic expectations, and I don\u2019t feel negatively about helping to feed my family nutritious, sustainable food.\nThese are two books that, after I read them, I said \u201cthat really pissed me off, but I\u2019d read it again, it made me think\u201d. Those are the great kinds of books.\nRecently I received an email forward concerning one of life\u2019s greatest joys- baby carrots. It was mildly concerning and cause for research.\nIf you know anything at all, you know that baby carrots, or cocktail carrots, are made by using a machine to cut and shape the wee ones from the large, probably misshapen carrots. Also, you know that they are delicious, nutritious, and good for night vision- what more would you want in a snack. Also, you should steam them, and season them with garlic and thyme or brown sugar\u2026if you know what\u2019s good for you.\nCheck out how they make those little guys:\nThis was not the concerning part of the email. This is:\n\u201c..once the carrots are cut and shaped into cocktail carrots they are dipped in a solution of water and chlorine in order to preserve them (this is the same chlorine used your pool) since they do not have their skin or natural protective covering, they give the m a higher dose of chlorine. You\u201d\nYou don\u2019t really buy this do you? I hope not. Because it is not true. Most fruits and vegetables are washed with a chemical compound after harvest, even organic produce; Fresh Express developed an acidic combination to wash their fruits and vegetables. There is a reason for this. The amount of chlorine or acid that is in the water mixture is so minimal, it is much less risky than eating produce that may be contaminated with bacteria found in nature that may cause food-borne illness. The primary way to avoid this is to grow your own produce, which is a good idea either way!\nThe thing that scares people, I think, is the white film that appears on carrots when they lose moisture. However, that has nothing to do with the chlorine. Sometimes called \u201ccarrot blush\u201d or \u201cwhite blush\u201d, it is caused by the loss of moisture drying the surface and causing rough cracks. It can also occur when surface cells are damaged, releasing an enzyme (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, if you\u2019re into that sort of thing). This makes small molecules called phenols to join together to form lignin, which is essentially the fibers that help hold plants together. This causes the whitening, but has no affect on the safety of the wee carrot babe.\nI personally love email forwards. They give me a much needed laugh, this one especially. Don\u2019t let chlorine scare you, after all, it is just an element found in nature that we are using to keep our food safe.\nSo, to sum things up, babies=great, carrots=great, baby carrots=super great. But overall, baby carrots=safe and healthy.\n\u201cWow, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m none too impressed with what you found out, as it doesn\u2019t address any real issues of \u2018meat production\u2019 and the safety of what we\u2019re eating (or the humane/inhumane treatment of animals).\nI would like to know:\n\u2013How many hours daily/weekly are the cows \u2018at pasture\u2019? how many hours daily/weekly confined?\n\u2013List the ingredients in their food & the ratio of each (grains in too high of a ratio are truly unnatural/unnatural for cows \u2013 and should only be given in the dead of winter as a \u2018supplement\u2019 to their hay (alfalfa/clover).\n\u2013How many \u201cchemicals\u201d are added to their food? And why? (and who cares if the FDA \u201capproves\u201d them or not\u2026poison is poison, eh?)\n\u2013Solid confirmation or denial of feeding animals GM grains (which have been proven to be horrendously toxic to any animal that eats them (including humans that eat those animals)\n\u2013the addition of selenium & Vitamin E is a MAJOR red flag. These things are NOT needed to prevent disease in animals that are provided food that is natural & healthy to them.\n\u2014What type (and how much) antibiotics are injected into these animals monthly? semi-annually? annually? And why are they needed at all (typically due to the rapid & rampant spread of disease caused by overcrowding, lack of Vitamin D {sunlight}, and grains/feed that are totally unnatural & stressful to the animal.\n\u2013What type (and how much) growth hormones are injected into these animals?\n\u2013What is the leading cause of disease/death, and why? \u2013How is disease managed in general? \u2013What is the most common disease? And how does that compare to animals that are pastured and fed healthy diets? \u2013What is done with diseased animals (i.e. do they make it into the food chain? ground up and added to animal/pet feed? {very common}, or disposed of properly?\nIf you\u2019re not able/willing/whatever to ask these questions and post them answers, will you please email me a few of the email addresses of those who previously answered your emails? My mother is wondering if it is safe/healthy for her to consume \u2018Amana Beef\u2019, and since \u201cmeat\u201d that has been \u2018grown as a commodity\u2019 in confinement operations has been proven to be a leading cause of disease & cancer, I would like to have the answers to provide to & for her.\nThank you!\u201d\nFirst and foremost, I have to apologize for the late response. My comment filter needs to be improved, because by the time I waded through 1,000+ spam comments relating to Louis Vuitton and other mildly alarming health benefits that are not of interest to me, I was extremely late in reading this comment.\nWhile looking for the best answers for this reader, I had a very hard time responding, a sentiment which other agriculturists agreed with. It seems as though their mind is already made up, and coming into a conversation with such a negative attitude toward my writing shows me that I should answer with nothing less than solid fact, both personal and scientific. So here I go: Continue reading \u2192\nEveryday as producers, we hear (we do, I promise) customer\u2019s concerns about the products that they are buying. But how much does the average person think about the food they\u2019re buying. We know, through modern research, that these concerns increase when people start having families or are providing for others, and also when finances are a strong concern. But when does this thinking start?\nIn my eighth grade class, we read excerpts of Upton Sinclair\u2019s The Jungle and Eric Schlosser\u2019s Fast Food Nation. To start the class, I wrote a question on the board. \u201cDo you think our food system is safe?\u201d Now, I have to admit, my timing was bad- I put this lesson in at the end of the quarter, and their desire to write was less than average. But I thought their responses wer interesting to read, so I thought I would share them:\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think about my food. I just eat it\u201d \u2013 Cody\n\u201cNo, it does not bother me, I just think it\u2019s safe\u201d \u2013 Zach\n\u201cI don\u2019t think about whether my food is safe or not as much as I should. I don\u2019t care what I eat anyway.\u201d \u2013 Trent\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is safe because you don\u2019t know where it comes from. It might have chemicals or pesticides. Or you could go to the store and get robbed and murdered! Dun dun dun\u201d \u2013 Jasmine\n\u201cYes, I think it\u2019s safe because I\u2019m pretty sure it gets cleaned and fertilized. If not I\u2019m screwed.\u201d -Alvaro Continue reading \u2192\nYesterday I was reading an article about new technology that would allow us to print meat. Print. Meat. A company named Modern Meadow was given $350,000 to develop an edible prototype of a meat replacement. Their short-term goal is creating a small piece of synthetic meat less than one inch long. You have to read the article to believe it. Their main purpose in creating synthetic meat is to create what they imagine as a more compassionate and sustainable food system surrounding meat.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve heard of 3D printing. They\u2019re using it to develop a number of synthetic materials and to solve a multitude of problems, specifically in the health field relating to medical implants. There is a lot of people who are extremely supportive and enthusiastic about the prospects of 3D printing.\nThen I have heard the ongoing complaints and praises for the new iPhone. People I know stood in line for the new model, then proceeded to point out all of its flaws. Nevertheless. when I asked why they don\u2019t switch to Android (like me), they claim that they would never betray their beloved Apple products.\nThen, finally, yesterday I was forwarded this article about vertical fields; growing crops on the sides of skyscrapers using a mechanical track bringing harvest-ready plants to the bottom of the building. Now, I\u2019m going to be the first to admit- this is a sweet idea. you go, environmental activists! But when I think of our 3000+ acres alone, and how we are such an extremely small percentage of the nation\u2019s growers, I simply cannot see the sides of a few buildings in Chicago as a sustainable option. But I still like it.\nNow, here is the point I originally wanted to write about. WHY do all of these ideas get wild praise, with all of their flaws, and proven technology like genetically modified seed is portrayed as the work of the devil? GM crops allow farmers reduce chemical spraying or to use less harmful chemicals. The crops also have lower production costs and higher output, benefits that generally outweigh the higher costs of the engineered seeds.\nThis is a sincere question: if you don\u2019t have an opinion pass this on to your friend- you know, that one who has an opinion on anything. I\u2019d especially love it if you forwarded this to your friend who hates modern agriculture. I sincerely, genuinely, passionately need to know why improved technology is wonderful, excluding innovation in agriculture. There is a double standard, and I can\u2019t wrap my head around it.\nI was making a video for agricultural promotion a few weeks ago, and I spoke a lot about what I do\u2026I am not a farmer. Yes, I\u2019m from the country and love to work on the family farm, but my full-time job is teaching. I love working with kids in any way, and I\u2019ve been in school to get my bachelor\u2019s in Family and Consumer Science Education for four years. Sometimes I think it\u2019s a little hypocritical to write about agriculture and farming when I\u2019m not a farmer, but with so much information, both correct and misled, floating around, it\u2019s \u201call hands on deck\u201d. But what does my career have to do with agriculture? A lot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "label": 1}
{"text": "Welcome to the Health Services Cost Review Commission\nHospital rate regulation in Maryland was established by an act of the Maryland legislature in 1971. The law created the Health Services Cost Review Commission (HSCRC), an independent State agency with seven Commissioners appointed by the Governor. The law was strongly supported by the hospital industry. The HSCRC was given broad responsibility regarding the public disclosure of hospital data and operating performance and was authorized to establish hospital rates to promote cost containment, access to care, equity, financial stability and hospital accountability.\nThe HSCRC has set rates for all payers, including Medicare and Medicaid, since 1977 and has largely achieved the key policy objectives established by the Maryland legislature. In recent years, the HSCRC has devoted considerable resources toward the development and implementation of payment-related initiatives designed to promote the overall quality of care in Maryland hospitals. Maryland remains the only state to retain such a system. The market for health care services in the United States has failed to produce results consistent with the Maryland legislature\u2019s founding goals. The Maryland system shows that a \u201cmacro-oriented\u201d approach to regulation, which seeks to correct only for the most obvious market failures, can assist policy-makers in controlling cost growth and, at the same time, enhancing access to care.", "label": 1}

{"text": "The weather this year has been extreme to say the least. The intense summer heat, the powerful ultraviolet (UV) rays we typically experience and the severe storms of the past few months, many of which produced damaging wind and hail, have taken their toll on the homes all across the United States. The combination of these elements can be devastating to the exterior of your home. While homeowners make repairs to roofing and windows, most fail to consider the harm the elements have caused to the exterior paint of their home. In addition, with winter only a few short months away, it is important that homeowners have their homes painted now before the ice and cold of winter will cause even more damage.\nThe Elements and Your Home's Exterior Paint\nWhile most quality exterior house paints are designed to withstand the elements, over time they will eventually begin to breakdown causing cracking, peeling and chalking. This breakdown can become accelerated as the weather becomes more intense.\n\u2022 Heat - Excessive temperature fluctuations can cause paint to crack and bubble overtime. Homes with more than one coat of paint are the most susceptible to heat damage. The difference in temperature between the exterior paint and the underlying paint layers causes stress fractures in the paint, resulting in cracks.\n\u2022 Moisture - Blistering and peeling are often the result of moisture from excessive rain, dew, snow, ice on the outside of your home, and buildup of vapor and moisture from underneath the paint. Damage to the exterior of your home, or the paint, can allow moisture to build up behind the exterior paint. When this moisture penetrates the paint it can form paint blisters, which eventually peel.\n\u2022 Ultraviolet Rays \u2013 In highly elevated areas in the Unites States UV rays are over 25% more intense than those experienced at sea level. UV rays breakdown paint pigments on a molecular level causing the paint's color to fade overtime. The UV rays also cause the resin within paint to slowly disintegrate, leaving a powdery, chalky film on the paints surface.\n\u2022 Hail - Hail storms are a common occurrence all across the US. Several 2013 storms were very extreme. Hail damages your home's exterior paint and can produce cracks, chips and splits which moisture can penetrate, causing even more damage to your home's paint. This moisture can also cause damage to the structure of your home over time if left untreated.\nProtecting Your Home from the Elements\nThere are a number of reasons why homeowners paint the exterior of their homes. A fresh coat of paint can not only transform a home, improving its curb appeal; it can also greatly increase a home's value. For these reasons, most homeowners looking to sell their home are advised by realtors to paint their home before putting it on the market.\nOne of the main reasons homeowners paint the exterior of their homes, however, is to protect it from the elements. Paint acts as a sealant and helps to prevent the deterioration of the home's exterior surfaces, which could lead to more expensive repairs later. After the extreme weather this Summer and Fall it is equally important that homeowners make sure the exteriors of their homes are properly painted and sealed before winter. Not only will the fresh paint help mend damage caused by the unusual weather, it will help prevent the harsh snow, sleet and ice from causing more costly damage during the winter months. Considering the weather the our country has already experienced this year in cities like Denver and NYC, our winter is bound to be an \"exciting\" one.\nThis article was contributed by Streamline Painting on 1/7/2014:\nStreamline Painting is a contributor for, the Howard Beach roofing wing and subsidiary of New Age Global Builders\nStreamline Painting can get your Denver area home painted before winter, protecting it from harsh Colorado ice and snow.

{"text": "You\u2019re probably reading the title of this post, thinking, \u201cis she nuts?\u201d Not at all. In fact, if I could have made it $700, but it doesn\u2019t have quite the same ring as $1000. But I\u2019m warning you, this method of getting married is not for most brides. Basically, I\u2019m going to share the story of how I got married.\nAll photos by Chuck Bennett\nYou\u2019d think a wedding decorator would have a huge, fancy wedding right? You\u2019d be wrong. Some might call this method eloping at home. There\u2019s a pretty interesting story. Interested?\nMy wonderful husband Trinity and I had been seeing each other for two years when circumstances seemed to push us to move in together \u2014 my landlord was raising my rent and his roommate was asking him to move out. But Trinity, boy scout that he is, didn\u2019t want us moving in together until we were married. So, we found our first condo together and began planning to get married in a civil ceremony.\nWe figured we could get married real quick in a civil ceremony the same day we picked up our marriage licenses, but apparently things don\u2019t work that way there \u2014 you have to make an appointment and all that. Plus, none of our friends and family could make it on that particular day, so we figured, sure we could postpone it another day to Saturday. Then Trinity had a flash of genius as we sat in Jack in the Box as we waited for our marriage license \u2014 he\u2019d heard Saturday was going to be a blue moon (the second full moon in a month) because his coworkers had talked about having a blue moon party. So he asked me \u2014 why not get married on the beach? I called my beach bunny friend Rita and asked her what beach we could get married at and she suggested Point Fermin Park, which actually is one of my favorite places in Southern California. So, after finishing at the courthouse, Trinity went off to find himself some white clothes before going to work. I went off to work and sent emails and made phone calls to friends we thought would want to be there. After work, I went to the Glendale Galleria (which happened to be in the city I was covering at the time) and scouted out a white dress \u2014 which ended up being under $20 at Robinsons-May. But I didn\u2019t buy it then, unfortunately.\nDid I mention that the next day was moving day? Yes. A lot of the folks helping us move were also friends present at our wedding. I was moving from my room in a house in South Pasadena, while Trinity was moving from his room in Pico Rivera to Monterey Hills, so it wasn\u2019t a whole lot of moving, but it was still pretty hectic. After finishing moving, our helpers hightailed it to get to their homes so they could shower and get ready, while I hightailed it to the Galleria to pick up the dress and get some shoes, armed with a $100 bill from Trinity. I arrived at the Galleria, famished after moving and running around, and stopped at the food court, fishing for the $100 bill in my pocket\u2026and discovered it was gone. I\u2019d lost it. And I never found it again. So I called Trinity, hightailed it back to Monterey Hills to pick up Trinity\u2019s credit card (and was admonished not to lose this one!), and rushed back to Glendale to get the dress and some relatively matching shoes. With dress and shoes in hand, I got back to our condo (!), showered behind a curtain that Trinity had just picked up and we got to San Pedro as fast as legally possible. Several of our friends were already waiting for us, including Rita and Sam, who picked the flowers for this cute little bouquet.\nTrinity and I stood under tree branches that formed an arch over us, while our friends formed a half circle around us. Our pastor married us in a short but sweet ceremony and Trinity put the ring he gave me on our 1st year anniversary (a promise ring) on my left ring finger, and I put a band (purchased that week, I think) on his left ring finger. (By the way, I didn\u2019t want another ring to keep track of.) And I hadn\u2019t even thought of a photographer, but Rita fortunately did \u2014 she called her photojournalist friend at the Torrance Daily Breeze, who shot these gorgeous photos and more! and created a lovely DVD for us.\nAnd that wasn\u2019t the end of the festivities. Many of our friends had to leave \u2014 heheh, some were already tired from helping us move, while other friends were pregnant and not having chicken at all \u2014 but those who could stick around came with us to Roscoe\u2019s Chicken and Waffles in Long Beach. Not exactly a reception, but it was definitely a good time with friends.\nSo, let\u2019s add it up:\nMarriage License: $70\nBride\u2019s dress: $20\nBride\u2019s shoes: $20\nBride losing cash: $100\nGroom\u2019s pants and shirt: $45\nGroom\u2019s shoes: $55\nGroom\u2019s ring: $270\nDinner: $40 (and I don\u2019t even know if we paid for our dinner!)\nAll that comes to $675. But getting married with no debt, with a memorable story to boot \u2014 that\u2019s priceless.\nWhat a great read!\nfantastic weddin its inspired me\nThats great! Did you have to get anything approved to have the wedding at the park? That park is amazing\nYou can have a beautiful outdoor wedding and reception here for as little as $750.

{"text": "Well, here we are.\nThere's nothing more we can write or say about Bill Snyder's return to Kansas State. Trust me on this.\nAll we can do now is watch and wait. The coach will make his triumphant return Saturday, in a stadium full of adoring fans and former players. The sun will shine. The air will smell like bratwurst and charcoal smoke. Someone will score a touchdown, the band will play, and everyone will drive home feeling warm and happy.\nThe stadium will clear out, fans leaving behind their empty cups and half-eaten nachos and magnetic schedules. The sports writers will file their stories and head home. The janitor will shut off the lights.\nEventually, the stadium will be completely empty, save for one slender, gray-haired coach watching film in a dark room.\nIt'll be a good day, I think.\nAnd hey, K-State could use a good day. There have been plenty of bad ones in the past year, what with the buyouts and the lawsuits and the lousy football. At their core, fans just want to be proud of something, and there hasn't been enough of that at K-State lately.\nBut still, it's only one day. For all the effort invested in this game -- the cheap tickets, the advertising campaign, the yard signs -- the real test is what happens next.\nSo what does happen next?\n\"That's a good question,\" athletic director John Currie said. \"Joni Smoller (K-State's fan experience director) came up with the idea of a bounce-back ticket, so if you come to the game, you can buy a ticket to the Tennessee Tech game for a real discount.\n\"I think we've got to continuously show our fans we're trying to get better. Coach Snyder talks about every single day, are you getting better? For us, from a fan experience standpoint, are we getting better every day?\"\nCurrie is doing the right things. He recognizes K-State's best chance at success is to throw its resources behind Snyder's comeback. He's controlling the things he can control and making sure K-State fans have the best experience possible when they attend a game.\nBut in sports, winning is the only effective long-term strategy. No matter how perfect things are on Saturday, it won't last if the Wildcats don't win.\nK-State has tried to keep expectations in check, but asking fans for patience is like asking college students for money. No coach -- even one as beloved as Snyder -- operates without a play clock.\nThe truth is, there's a lot of uncertainty in K-State's future. If the Wildcats struggle this season, the stadium could be half-empty on senior day. The enthusiasm generated by Snyder's return could wane, and the fan base could grow restless again.\nA family reunion won't fix everything, and it won't magically rebuild a program that had begun to crumble. But if the Wildcats are going to win again, it has to start somewhere.\nMaybe it starts with one good day.\nAustin Meek can be reached at austin.meek@cjonline.com.\nAustin Meek can be reached at austin.meek@cjonline.com.", "label": 1}
{"text": "Sampler Flight: March 10\u201317\nBrandon Hern\u00e1ndez 9 a.m., March 11\nWho are the new would-be owners of the Padres, and are they fit to own the team? Recent documents unearthed from city hall under the California Public Records Act suggest that City officials may not be doing enough to find out.\nThe public face of the Padres\u2019 new ownership is ex\u2013sports agent and former Arizona Diamondbacks co-owner Jeff Moorad. But Moorad has declined to say who else is buying the team with him.\nThe question of ownership is critical to San Diego taxpayers, who subsidize Petco Park to the tune of $11 million a year, as well as to baseball fans, who want to make sure the new owners have enough money to build a winning team.\nThe need for information has become more urgent as rumors have grown about whether Moorad and his unidentified partners have the financial wherewithal and business acumen to run a successful team over the long run.\nBut does the City even have the right to ask about such matters? Section 13.3 of the Petco Park Joint Use and Management Agreement between the City and Padres, L.P., dated February 1, 2000, addresses that issue:\n\u201cThe Padres have the right to transfer ownership of the Padres\u2019 franchise during the Term to the extent permitted by Major League Baseball, without the City\u2019s consent; provided, however, that in connection with such sale, the new franchise owner must (i) concurrently acquire all of the Padres rights and obligations in, to and under the Franchise and this Agreement, and (ii) concurrently agree in writing, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the City, to assume all of the Padres\u2019 obligations under this Agreement for the remainder of the Term.\u201d\nThat seems simple and reasonable enough. The new owners, whoever they are, must furnish the City with a signed statement agreeing to shoulder the same financial obligations to San Diego taxpayers as the previous owner, John Moores, had agreed to. If they don\u2019t, there\u2019s the very real possibility that they might walk away at any time, leaving the taxpayers high and dry.\nBut the new owners may not be asked to make that written commitment. In a letter dated February 17, Katherine K. Pothier, executive vice president of the Padres, asserts that \u201cneither Section 13.3 nor Section 28.17 applies to the Transaction.\u201d\nShe goes on to say, \u201cThe Transaction involves the sale of partnership interests in the Padres, which will continue to own, operate and manage the Franchise. There is not and will not be any new franchise owner or entity to assume obligations under the JUMA.\u201d\nIn other words, Pothier, a lawyer, makes a lawyerly argument that Padres L.P., a Delaware limited partnership that technically owns the Padres franchise, remains the owner of the team \u2014 even though the partnership\u2019s old owners are being exchanged for new owners, as yet to be identified.\nAt the bottom of her letter, Pothier provided a signature line for the City to attest that it has \u201cAccepted and Approved\u201d her interpretation of the contract. On the copy of the letter furnished by the City that line remains blank.\nIf Pothier\u2019s interpretation prevails, the City won\u2019t be able to find out anything about the financial wherewithal and business reputation of whoever is buying the team. Will the City take on the Padres and its new buyers in order to defend the integrity of its agreement with the team?\nApparently the jury is still out.\nThere is one more wrinkle. The city charter contains Section 225, which requires that anybody doing business with the City must make complete disclosure of the names and identities of those direct and indirect owners.\nTim Moore, City ballpark administrator, says the City hasn\u2019t yet decided whether it will invoke Section 225 and ask for that information.\n\u201cNo transaction has taken place yet,\u201d Moore said in a telephone interview last week. \u201cIt [Section 225] may not be relevant to this transaction.\u201d City emails released under the Public Records Act show that Padres vice president Pothier has been lobbying hard against any disclosure under Section 225.\nIn a February 12 email to Moore and deputy city attorney Brock Ladewig, she wrote, \u201cI reviewed Section 225 of the City Charter and do not think it applies. The right and the lease have already been granted to the Padres L.P. and is not being altered. No additional rights are being granted. Padres L.P. continues to hold the interest.\u201d\nThat drew a quick response from Ladewig. \u201cKatie, I must respectfully disagree with your analysis. I believe new persons will be gaining some \u2018right, title or interest arising out of a contract\u2019 when the new partners are installed. If the issue becomes a problem, we can look at this more closely.\u201d Reached by phone this week, Ladewig said he has had no further contact with Pothier.\nBruce Henderson, a former city councilman and longtime critic of the 1998 deal between the City and John Moores that created Petco Park and surrounding developments, says there is no question that Section 225 should be applied to the latest transaction.\n\u201cSection 225 is a very important rule that government is supposed to be following. Right in its title it says that it is mandatory. And the purpose of 225 is very simple: council members, the mayor, city staff should know whose economic interests are before them in order to be certain there is no conflict of interest, and the public needs to know the same thing, so if there is a conflict of interest they can blow the whistle on it.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why 225 was passed overwhelmingly by the voters in 1992. There was no real opposition to it. It was added as a charter amendment, not just a section of the municipal code but a mandatory provision of the charter.\u201d\nSan Diego\u2019s history of finance-related political scandals \u2014 including the Valerie Stallings case, in which the city councilwoman was forced to resign after receiving gifts from Padres owner Moores \u2014 makes enforcement of Section 225 critical.\n\u201cIf something is going to be acted on by the city council, staff should at the very outset find out whose economic interests are directly or indirectly affected,\u201d Henderson says. \u201cThat way as staff works on it and as the matter works its way up to city council, everyone knows whose economic interests are involved. If you get the disclosures right in the beginning it helps you avoid potential conflicts of interest.\u201d\nmonaghan March 25, 2009 @ 12:22 p.m.\nOhmigod, Bruce Henderson is baaack. Now that he's no longer working in the City Attorney's office under Mike Aguirre, he's delivering opinions again on Padres' issues for Matt Potter. I don't know if I'm glad or appalled....\nJustWondering March 25, 2009 @ 12:49 p.m.\nI for one can't understand the reason for NOT disclosing who owners are and their percentage of ownership. Public money has been and is being used to make Petco Park available for use in one form or another. Public financing of the bonds that built Petco Park will be paid for years to come. Non-disclosure, if nothing else, gives the impression somebody has something to hide. In addition, when the Padres Executive Counsel and VP Katherine K. Pothier, works to develop novel interpretations of the law, just to keep ownership information under wraps, ALARM BELLS should be ringing loudly at City Hall.\npaul March 25, 2009 @ 2:40 p.m.\nMatt, did the city ever apply Section 225 to Padres L.P. in the first place? My guess is that they probably didn't, or that if they did, the ownership was made up largely of other Delaware companies and that their ownership was not disclosed. I wonder how much of the Padres Valerie Stallings owns? (tongue firmly in cheek)\nMy understanding is that the city routinely does major business with Delaware companies and rarely invokes Section 225.\nrbrocker March 25, 2009 @ 3:50 p.m.\nAccording to earlier stories from I believe, The Mooreses reportedly own 90 percent of the team. Because of community property laws in California, Becky Moores shares 50 percent of that asset. Their daughter, Jennifer, owns five percent and the other five percent is owned by Glenn Doshay, a San Diego businessman\nStrange thing is, when Alderson came about it was reported he would be a minority owner as well, of course he could have sold his share back.\nSanDiegoParrothead March 25, 2009 @ 4:19 p.m.\nFor those who would like to directly contact the crooks, er people, involved ...\nKatherine K.

They're the ones who lied to us, ripped off the city for hundreds of millions of dollars, and are now living in luxury because people like you refused to listen to Henderson.\nWhy do you think the city is bankrupt? It's precisely because of the deals Henderson opposed.

{"text": "Overcoming Barriers To FTTH Deployment in MDUs Many property owners hesitate to deploy fiber in multifamily buildings because of concerns about cost, disruption and aesthetics. With newer deployment methods, these concerns are no longer warranted. By Linnea Wilkes \u25a0 3M Communication Markets Division M uch research has been done on the financial benefits of offering broadband service in apartments and condominiums. In the rental market, property owners and managers agree that services such as high-speed Internet and video on de- mand can help fill units and retain ten- ants longer. In the condo market, access to broadband can boost the value of a home and help it sell more quickly. Today, prospective tenants and own- ers want to know not only whether a property offers broadband services but also how good those services are. A 2012 study by RVA LLC (sponsored by this magazine and discussed in the July is- sue) surveyed multiple-dwelling-unit (MDU) property owners and managers of both condos and rental properties. Of those surveyed, 59 percent responded that \"superior\" broadband increases closing and occupancy rates, 42 percent agreed that it reduced resident churn and 39 percent acknowledged that broad- band availability increased rental prices. When it comes to the particular me- dium for delivering broadband, numer- ous studies have shown that subscribers highly value fiber-to-the-home service. Studies indicate that FTTH subscrib- ers are more satisfied with their broad- band and TV service than DSL, cable and wireless customers are. In a survey of MDU residents by Parks Associates, 42 percent of respondents perceived the rental value of a living unit with FTTH service to be an average of 5 percent higher than that of a unit lacking FTTH. If FTTH can bolster property and rental values and occupancy rates, why do only 7 percent of MDU households in the U.S. have FTTH service? BARRIERS TO DEPLOYING FIBER If high-speed services can bolster prop- erty and rental values and occupancy rates and if FTTH is the preferred way to deliver those services, why do only 7 percent of MDU households in the United States today have FTTH ser- vice? In the RVA survey, responding property owners and managers named the following as their top five barriers to installing an FTTH network (percent- age of respondents agreeing with reason in parentheses): \u2022 Cost of installation (69 percent) \u2022 Time/hassle of making change (54 percent) \u2022 Disruption to residents during in- stallation (52 percent) \u2022 Not sure return on investment is suf- ficient (50 percent) \u2022 Aesthetics or look of installed fiber cables (43 percent).

In- longer installation times and higher costs associated with fiber deployment in older MDUs have hindered service providers' ability to fully realize the financial promise of the MDU category of housing. Deploying fiber in existing apartments and condominiums is challenging on many fronts. No two MDUs are alike, and no single solution fits all. Tese basic truths can immediately create physical and fi- nancial impediments for service provid- ers. Retrofitting existing structures for fiber poses engineering challenges that can slow the installation process, add to its cost and often result in awkward- looking installations. Outside-plant solutions don't trans- late easily into an MDU environment, where overcoming space restrictions and aesthetic objections are significant chal- lenges.

They are super cool and we kind of want to go to befriend them and admire their collection of coffee mugs and incents. Yes, that\u2019s right, we are talking about hipsters. From where to hang out, to taking the perfect cappuccino Instagram, they are ahead of the game. This certainly is true about their fashion too. The hipster look is always changing \u2014 because who wants to wear what everyone else is wearing, right?\nThe spectrum of hipster style stretches wide, but there are some key essentials in most looks. One of those essentials is the beanie. The slouchy headwear is perfect for achieving a laid-back and cool look. Our Fashionisto wore a black one over his Ray-Ban style sunglasses. If you like the look, but wouldn\u2019t consider yourself a true hipster yet, then a black beanie is a great place to start. A neutral colored one can be worn with a multitude outfits and can work at any point on the hipster scale.\nOur featured Fashionisto paired his beanie with a blue plaid button-up. Plaid is most certainly a staple in any hipster\u2019s closet. An easy way to wear plaid is to pair it with jeans and a jacket. If you want an edgier look, choose a leather jacket. This will add a punk element to your look and also create a cohesive outfit. If you are going for more of a casual style, try leaving your plaid shirt unbuttoned with a solid colored V-neck or T-shirt underneath. Pair with jeans and a neutral colored shoe and you have a great hipster-inspired casual outfit.\nIf you don\u2019t have time to search your local thrift store for some original clothing finds, then Topshop is a great alternative. The whole Topshop site is always on top of trends, so you will surely find something that none of your friends have yet. If you want a look similar to the one in the featured photo, they\u2019ve got you covered with tons of basic beanies and plaid options. If you want something a little more unique, they also offer an multi-colored plaid button-up. This is a great choice for the true trendsetter.\nHint: One way to add an extra unique element to an outfit is to rock a pair of boots. With styles ranging from biker to combat, there are tons of options to choose from. Pick one that fits your personality and match your outfit accordingly. A great pair of boots is definitely distinctive and will give your outfit the perfect hipster edge.", "label": 1}
{"text": "In this population-based study we did not observe any associations between HT and the risk of colorectal cancer mortality or all-cause mortality, regardless of its definition. Among women with proximal colon cancer diagnoses, a modest increased risk of both colorectal cancer and all-cause mortality was observed among long-term users of HT that was attenuated with increasing time since last use of HT. Our confidence in these study results is enhanced by the population based nature of our study, and our ability to adjust for important confounders not available in prior studies, especially screening history.\nOur results appear to be in contrast with previous studies of HT use and colon cancer mortality in two previous cohorts of cases; both found inverse relationships between HT use prior to diagnosis and mortality[13\n, 14\n]. Slattery et al\n. found that, after a mean 7 years of follow-up after colon cancer diagnosis, women who had ever used HT had a statistically significant 40% lower risk of colorectal cancer mortality than non-users [14\n]. Similarly, Mandelson et al\n., after 6 years of follow-up, also showed a reduction in mortality associated with HT use, although this reduction appeared to be limited to lesions in the distal colon (hazard ratio=0.33, 95% CI, 0.13-0.83) [13\n]. Notably, neither study adjusted for history of endoscopy screening. These effects of screening on colorectal cancer prognosis make this a potentially important confounder in epidemiologic studies of colorectal cancer. In a post-hoc\nanalysis, although our study did not find differences in risk when screening was removed from our models, we did observe that HT users were more likely to have been screened and been diagnosed with more localized cancers that non-HT users. Women with a history of screening were also more likely to have localized disease (45% and 40% of women diagnosed with localized disease for screened and unscreened, respectively). Additionally, the Mandelson et al.\nstudy [13\n] relied on linkages of pharmacy records to medical records, and thus it was not possible to adjust for other potential important correlates of HT, such as body mass index. In prior studies examining overall mortality among cohorts of healthy women, the relationship with HT use has been modestly inverse, with the greatest reductions in risk among current HT users [15\n, 24\n]. Such a finding is likely consistent with the strong reductions in incidence associated with current HT use, which is impossible to separate from an association with mortality in this design.\nBased upon these limited studies and contradictory results, it is difficult to reach a consensus on the relationship between HT use and colorectal cancer mortality. There is some evidence that the association between HT and colorectal cancer incidence varies by stage of disease. In the Women\u2019s Health Initiative (WHI) trial, women who used estrogen plus progestin were more likely to be diagnosed at an advanced stage of disease (i.e. regional or metastatic) than cases in the placebo arm (76.2% vs. 48.5%, p=0.004, ref.[5\n]). After adjustment for stage at diagnosis, no increased or decreased risk of colorectal cancer mortality was observed among our cohort of women. Thus our results appear to be consistent with this randomized controlled trial.\nWhen interpreting the results of this study, several limitations should be considered. We measured HT use 1-2 years prior to diagnosis, and did not evaluate HT use after diagnosis. Thus, there could be some misclassification of the exposure if women who were non-users initiated HT use after their colorectal cancer diagnosis, or selectively continued HT use. Such treatment patterns would be relatively unlikely since, in general as a promoter, HT is often contraindicated after a diagnosis of some cancers because of its growth promoting properties [27\n]. We were unable to interview all eligible cases, and 17% of women were deceased before we could enroll them. The loss of subjects due to death is always raises concerns about the possibility of survival bias. However, the results of our case-control study, upon which this study is based, found a strong inverse association with HT that was consistent with the findings of other prospective studies, as well as the Women\u2019s Health Initiative, where losses to death were not an issue [2\n]. Women in the study who reported use of HT, however, were actually slightly more likely than non-users to be diagnosed at an earlier stage, so bias towards the null due to advanced stage appears unlikely to explain these results. In addition, our previous study of body mass and colorectal cancer mortality [20\n], found no differences in associations with mortality among the different stages of cancer diagnoses. Finally, our sample sizes for several subcategories were quite small, thus limiting our ability to detect some associations of interest, and limiting our ability to assess effect modification; these results may also be due to chance due to the limited power and multiple comparisons.\nThere is ample biologic plausibility that estrogens may exert an effect on colorectal cancer incidence [1\n], possibly through several mechanisms. Indeed, the colon contains hormone receptors that are likely pivotal in its responsiveness to sex hormones[28\n]. However, the mechanisms by which HT use might impact survival remain poorly studied. In our study, women who developed incident proximal colon cancer even while using HT prior to diagnosis may have developed tumors resistant to the benefits of HT. If these women develop colon cancer despite exogenous estrogen use, other genetic or environmental factors predisposing women to colorectal cancer may predominate. The presence of differential etiologic pathways predominating in users versus non-users of HT by colon cancer site needs to be explored, in the laboratory, clinic, and population.", "label": 1}

ItThe rapper recalled taking his first Vicodin when he was 24 or 25, back before he could afford anything he wanted. \u201cIt was easy in the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the money to get really involved in drugs. I\u2019d do them when somebody offered them to me. As my career took off and the crowds got larger and life got faster, I reached out for that sh\u2013 more and more. I used it as a crutch to calm my nerves. Especially the sleeping pills.\u201d\nBut as his addiction deepened, the drugs began affecting his art, stifling his creativity, shutting off his brain and making him so lazy he preferred watching TV to making new tracks. He said that while listening to albums such as 2004\u2032s Encore, he can hear how high he was in the music. \u201cI think the drug use was obvious,\u201d he said.\nWhile late partner Proof tried to get him off the pills, Em said even hearing deep concern from his childhood best friend wasn\u2019t enough to get him to come clean. \u201cHe\u2019d say what was on his mind,\u201d Marshall said of Proof. \u201cBut as close as he was, it didn\u2019t matter. I wasn\u2019t ready to listen. There wasn\u2019t\u2019s album Relapse. In retrospect, he realized that there were some problems with the record.\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t disappointed when I put it out. When I felt that was later, when I was reassessing my work #8212; trying to figure out why my songs didn\u2019t sound like they used to sound,\u201d he said. \u201cThe further I got away from Relapse, I was able to hear the problems with all the accents I was using to slip in and out of characters, and how the serial killing didn\u2019t work. The joke was over #8212; I ran it into the ground.\u201d\nHe realized the problem was an obvious lack of \u201cpersonal honesty\u201d on the tracks, a situation he rectified on Recovery with such hit tracks as \u201cNot Afraid\u201d and the Rihanna collabo \u201cLove The Way You Lie.\u201d Once his head finally cleared, Em said, he was a new man, which might explain why he ditched plans to make Relapse 2 and start over with Recovery", "label": 1}

Before, that was something only major governments had done.\n\"Falcon flew perfectly!!\" SpaceX's billionaire founder, Elon Musk, said via Twitter. \"Dragon in orbit ... Feels like a giant weight just came off my back.\"\nMusk later told reporters: \"I feel very lucky ... For us, it's like winning the Super Bowl.\"\nThis time, the Falcon's nine engines kept firing all the way through liftoff. On Saturday, flight computers aborted the launch with a half-second remaining in the countdown; a bad engine valve was replaced.\nThe White House quickly flight beyond low Earth orbit.\"\nFlight controllers applauded when the Dragon reached orbit nine minutes into the flight, then embraced one another once the solar panels on the spacecraft popped open. Many of the SpaceX controllers wore untucked T-shirts and jeans or even shorts, a stark contrast to NASA's old suit-and-tie shuttle crowd.\nThe hopes of SpaceX employees were riding on that rocket, Musk noted, and everyone felt \"tremendous elation.\"\nSo did NASA.\nThe space agency is banking on the switch from government to commercial cargo providers in the U.S., now that the shuttles no longer are flying. Astronauts could begin taking commercial rides to the space station in three to five years, if all goes wellThe real test comes Thursday when the Dragon reaches the vicinity of the space station. It will undergo practice maneuvers from more than a mile out. If all goes well, the docking will occur Friday. Musk will preside over the operation from the company's Mission Control in Hawthorne, Calif., where he monitored the liftoff.\nThe space station was zooming over the North Atlantic, just east of Newfoundland, when the Falcon took flight.\nNASA is looking to the private sector to take over orbital trips in this post-shuttle period and several U.S. companies are vying for the opportunity. The goal is to get American astronauts launching again from U.S. soil \u2014 creating jobs at home and halting the outsourcing, as Bolden put it.\nUntil their retirement last summer to museums, NASA's shuttles provided the bulk of space station equipment and even the occasional crew member. American astronauts are riding Russian rockets to orbit until SpaceX or one of its competitors takes over the job. Russia also is making periodic cargo hauls, along with Europe and Japan.\nMusk, a co-creator of PayPal, founded SpaceX a decade ago. He's poured millions of his own money into the company, and NASA has contributed $381 million as seed money. In all, the company has spent more than $1 billion on the effort.\nHundreds of SpaceX and NASA guests poured into the launching area in the early morning hours Tuesday, eager to see firsthand the start of this new commercial era. The company had a single second to get its rocket flying, and that's all it needed.\nEveryone, it seemed, was rooting for a successful flight \u2014 even Musk's rivals another few years.\nThe six space station astronauts were especially enthusiastic. The crew beamed down a picture on the eve of the launch, showing the two who will use a robot arm to snare the Dragon.\nIn December 2010, SpaceX became the first private company to launch a spacecraft into orbit and retrieve it. That test flight of a Dragon capsule paved the way for this mission, which also is meant to culminate with a splashdown of the capsule in the Pacific.\nThis newest capsule is supposed to remain at the space station for a week before bringing back experiments and equipment. None of the other types of current cargo ships can return safely; they burn up on the way down.\nSpaceX and NASA officials stress this is a demonstration flight and that even if something goes wrong, much can be learned. Two more Dragon supply missions are planned this year, regardless of what happens during this week's rendezvous.\nWhile acknowledging the difficult course ahead in the next few days, Musk and NASA officials savored Tuesday's triumph.\n\"I would really count today as a success, no matter what happens the rest of the mission,\" Musk said.\nMusk, 40, is the chief executive officer and chief designer for SpaceX. He also runs Tesla Motors, his electric car company.\nHitching a ride into space, aboard the discarded second stage of the rocket, were the ashes of more than 300 people, including Mercury astronaut Gordon Cooper and \"Star Trek\" actor James Doohan, who played Scotty. It's a redo flight for a paying customer, Houston-based Celestis Inc.

I also haven't seen all the episodes so sorry if something doesn't match up!\nThis story takes place during the episode We'll Always Have Detention.\nPairing: Carl/Denise\nWhen the shimmer of gold disappeared, Carl could see Denise's face immerge. She walked towards him, not yet giving an explanation as to why she had just used her magic to take a trip into his living room. She smiled weakly at him, and he felt himself slightly blush \u2013 and he was very glad that the spell causing them to turn blue had been lifted, or else he would have been turning a dark shade of indigo.\n\"I'm sorry things didn't work out with Surfergirl8,\" Denies said with a dose of sympathy. \"You and Brittany really were a good match.\"\nCarl shrugged. \"I thought so, too, after that first date.\"\nIt was Denise's turn to blush, but she nodded anyways. \"Look, Carl. That's why I came here \u2013 I have a confession. It wasn't Brittany on that date. It was\u2013\"\n\"You, I know. Porter told me,\" the boy interjected, informing her he already knew. \"Why'd you do it? Were you... jealous?\"\n\"What?\" Denies said, surprise in her voice. \"No!\"\nCarl gave her a blank stare, waiting for her to further explain why she had impersonated their blond friend.\n\"I thought Porter was the guy Brittany was waiting to meet up with, and knowing that human relationships with AIT's...\" she cleared her throat awkwardly, and continued, \"...don't work... I wanted to find a better match for Brittany.\"\n\"Why me?\" Carl questioned.\nFidgeting with her bracelet, Denise continued to explain. \"Carl, you weren't the only guy I tried to set up with Britt! But Surge and Alex are not exactly boyfriend material! So when I saw you in the hallway, I thought that you and Brittany might just hit it off. Plus, I wanted you to be happy!\"\nCarl crossed his arms. \"But because of that first date I went on with Brittany \u2013 which was really you \u2013 my date with the real Brittany totally bombed!\"\nThe AIT took a few steps closer to Carl, so they were standing directly in front of each other. \"I'm sorry Carl. I didn't mean to miss things up between you two. I was just trying to be a good friend!\"\nCarl smiled at her, and she returned it.\n\"So,\" Denise began. \"Do you think you and Brittany will be able to make things work? Because you guys are such a good match!\"\n\"You know,\" Carl said. \"I thought that too, after we connected online, and had such a fun time together ditching detention \u2013 and Britt is a great girl! But when I really connected with her... was my first date with her,\" he finished slowly.\nA layer of red made its way up to Denise's cheeks as Carl said this. \"Really?\"\nCarl nodded, a small smile on his face. \"During the date, you reached out and grabbed my hand, and I felt a huge spark between us. When I thought I had that connection with Brittany, it didn't make sense. But when Porter told me it was you \u2013 everything clicked.\"\nDenise reached out and gently grabbed a hold of Carl's hand. They both smiled at the electricity climbing from their fingers, onto their palms, up their arms, into their hearts.\n\"I missed this,\" Denise admitted. \"When I thought you and Brittany were so perfect together \u2013 I didn't really put myself into the equation, considering the fact that it was me on that date. Maybe you aren't perfect for the real Brittany after all.\"\nCarl nodded in agreement. \"But I sure do like the fake-Brittany.\"\nDenise tightened her grasp on Carl's hand.\n\"Why is this all so complicated?\" Carl asked her with a sigh.\n\"I don't know! If I had known trying to find a boyfriend for Brittany would have been this confusing I wouldn't have done it! I mean, I had to kiss Porter!\"\nCarl laughed. \"You are probably the only girl who has ever kissed Porter without swooning afterwards!\"\n\"He does not have that effect on me!\"\n\"Why not?\" Carl asked, still slightly chuckling at the idea of Denise kissing Porter.\n\"He isn't you...\" Denise said quietly.\nCarl immediately stopped laughing at those words, and his face softened. \"Seriously?\"\n\"Yeah,\" Denise said, more confidently this time.\nCarl smiled, and leaned in towards Denise, his lips were barely touching hers when they heard a snap. They turned away from each other to see Porter, who had just appeared in the room.\nDenise practically jumped away from Carl, but kept her hand tightly in his. \"Porter!\" she snapped.\n\"What were you guys doing?\" Porter asked, concerned. \"You guys have already been caught for having a relationship!\"\nCarl, lost for words, tried to explain. \"We were- well, Denise was- and I was...\"\n\"Shhh,\" Denise said, rubbing her thumb on his hand to silence him from further rambling.\n\"You guys know the rule about AIT's dating humans!\" Porter lectured, and Carl was surprised that he didn't start pacing the room. \"If you get caught again then Denise will be sent away. Is that what you want, Carl?\"\nCarl scratched at the back of his neck. \"No,\" he mumbled honestly.\nPorter nodded. \"Make sure you know what you're getting into. Don't cause more trouble, Denise!\"\nThe AIT's looked at each other, and Denise scoffed. \"It figures you'd blame this on me!\"\n\"Well you do cause difficulties a lot...\" Porter confessed.\n\"Guys,\" Carl interjected. \"Not a good time!\"\n\"Right. I'll, uh, leave you guys to talk.\"\n\"Thanks, man.\" Carl said, and Denise stepped slightly closer to him, their fingers still entwined.\nWith a snap of his fingers, Porter disappeared from the room, leaving Denise and Carl alone once again.\n\"Way to ruin a mood,\" Carl said with a smile.\nDenise grinned at him. \"Porter ruins everything,\" she joked. They laughed together for a moment, before the mood of their complicated situation took over once more.\nDenise turned back to Carl, and spoke quietly. \"You know, before you, I never believed that an angle could be in love with a human. Actually, I didn't even really believe in love at all! But there's something special about you. And I don't want to have to let you go...\"\nCarl nodded. \"But you know as well as I do that Porter is right. I can't risk losing you all together.\" From the moment Denise appeared in the room, Carl knew it would cause trouble. But he never expected this. \"And until today I actually thought I could maybe get over you. But now I realize that I've liked you ever since our first date.\"\n\"Me too!\" Denise exclaimed at the similarity.\nCarl smiled, because he was happy to finally be on the same page as Denise again, and he finally knew what she was thinking. There was no more guessing.\n\"Well,\" Carl said. \"I guess we have two options at this point.\"\nDenise tilted her head \u2013 not quite sure what those options were.\n\"We can do what we are supposed to, and just be friends. Forget about this entire day and the relationship we had. Or...\" he trailed of slightly, and lowered his voice. \"We could be really sneaky about it this time.\"\nDenise laughed. \"How sneaky?\"\n\"The kind of sneaky,\" Carl began. \"That is so under wraps that only you and I can know about it.\"\nA smile grew on Denise's face. \"Like a secret boyfriend? Sounds fun.\"\n\"Sounds dangerous,\" Carl corrected, but he didn't mean it.\nDenise shrugged. \"I like danger. And messing with the system.\"\n\"I've noticed!\" Carl said, with a dry laugh. \"Like when you turned me into a girl.\"\nA laugh escaped Denise at the memory. \"Carly was cute!\" she said.\n\"So,\" Carl began, returning to the point. \"Secretly dating?\"\nDenise's mouth twisted in contemplation. \"Yeah,\" she finally agreed, with a nod for good measure.\nCarl smiled, wide, and reached forward to give her a hug. Denise pulled back too quickly. \"We might need to find a more confidential place.\"\nCarl nodded in agreement. \"Do you know anywhere?\"\n\"A few places,\" Denise told him, before grabbing his arm.\nWith a snap of her fingers they disappeared, leaving Carl's living room deserted.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Snowy winters don't always translate to spring floods, but it appears the cause-and-effect relationship might hold true this year.\nRoutt County Emergency Management Director Chuck Vale warned county commissioners Monday that local \"high-water events\" will almost certainly affect some residents. We hope Vale's warning doesn't come to fruition, but it serves as an important reminder to residents and business owners who could fall victim to fast-rising creeks and rivers during the next few weeks.\nAs of Monday, high country snowpack and water content at measuring sites around Steamboat Springs remained near or, in some cases, significantly above historic averages. A relatively cool April kept much of the lower-elevation snowpack in place, increasing the likelihood that runoffs from low and high elevations will overlap. Sustained rainfall would facilitate the melt-off while also adding additional water to the equation. The result could easily overwhelm area riverbanks.\nWhile Vale was quick to point out that he doesn't expect local homes to float away, property damage is a very real possibility. Residents should begin acting now to make sure they don't become victims.\nA logical first step is for residents to determine whether their home or business is in a floodplain. Visit the Federal Emergency Management Administration's mapping page at www.fema.gov/business/nfip/mscjumppage.shtm to search for copies of local floodplain maps. The site gives you the option to view the map on your computer monitor. Maps also can be purchased.\nIf you live or work in such an area, be prepared to help yourself. Local governments have made it clear that their No. 1 priority during high-water events is to first protect public infrastructure. Accordingly, residents should:\n- Prepare an evacuation plan from their home or business\n- Consider purchasing flood insurance\n- Make a list of personal property to assist with insurance claims\n- Prepare an emergency kit for your home, car and workplace, including a flashlight with batteries, nonperishable food, bottled water and a first aid kit\n- Keep important papers in watertight containers, and keep records of valuables in a safe place where water isn't likely to reach\n- Establish a contact person for your family members to reach in the event of a flood\n- Teach children about high-water safety, and keep children and pets away from creeks and rivers during spring runoff\nIf you live or work in a high-risk flood area, you might consider building a levee with sandbags. Sandbags are available locally, and your town or city government may provide them at no cost. When trying to determine how much time and sand it will take to build a protective barricade, consider that a levee 20 feet long and 1 foot high requires 7 cubic yards of sand and 100 sandbags. Two people can fill and place 100 sandbags in approximately one hour.\nOther safety concerns arise during the annual spring runoff, particularly drowning danger. Children and pets should be kept away from creek beds and riverbanks. Motorists shouldn't attempt to drive through flooded roadways, as it takes only 2 feet of water to carry away most vehicles.\nFinally, consult with local agencies such as Routt County Emergency Management Services (870-5551) for more information. Vale has prepared a high water preparedness guide available in his department's first-floor office in the Routt County Courthouse Annex on Sixth Street.\nSpring flooding constitutes a threat to public safety and personal property.

{"text": "|Adenoidectomy Technique in the United Kingdom and Postoperative Hemorrhage.\nMedLine Citation:\n|PMID: 21493271 Owner: NLM Status: Publisher\n|Objective. To investigate the incidence of postoperative hemorrhage and its risk factors after adenotonsillectomy. Study Design. A prospective cohort study as part of the National Prospective Tonsillectomy Audit. Setting. National Health Service and private hospitals in England and Northern Ireland. Subjects and Methods. National Prospective Tonsillectomy Audit methodology was followed with a nonrandomized prospective observational cohort methodology and data collection. Results. A total of 33,921 patients underwent tonsillectomy; of these, 9900 underwent adjunctive adenoidectomy. Traditional curette adenoidectomy (without any diathermy use at all) was performed in 6871 patients. Suction diathermy technique was used in 1489 patients. Hemorrhage rates were calculated for these main adenoidectomy technique groups and compared by calculation of risk ratios. Both early and late hemorrhage rates for suction diathermy were found to be 0.07% (n = 1 in each case). In the traditional curette group, these rates were 0.3% (n = 19) and 0.2% (n = 14), respectively. The risk ratio for hemorrhage overall was 3.6 for curette adenoidectomy compared with suction diathermy (95% confidence interval, 0.86-14.9; P = .06). The data suggest comparable hemorrhage rates in both adenoidectomy technique groups and fail to demonstrate diathermy usage as a risk factor for hemorrhage following adenoidectomy despite a clear interaction between diathermy usage and subsequent hemorrhage in tonsillectomy. Conclusion. Use of suction diathermy in adenoidectomy appears to have a similar safety profile to conventional techniques and may offer additional benefits over traditional adenoid curettage. Further clinical and laboratory-based research into the complex interaction between diathermy usage and both adenoid and tonsillar tissue is warranted.\n|David Lowe; Peter Brown; Matthew Yung\nPublication Detail:\n|Type: JOURNAL ARTICLE Date: 2011-3-18 Mar\nDate Detail:\n|Created Date: 2011-4 ENT, James Cook University Hospitalomotor Skills Training in Pediatric Airway Endoscopy Simulation.\nNext Document: Polarization-Sensitive Optical Coherence Tomography Imaging of Benign and Malignant Laryngeal Lesion...", "label": 1}
{"text": "Related Stories\nAccording to Rich Cimini of ESPN New York, Giants RB Brandon Jacobs said that a former teammate, Jets WR Plaxico Burress, will be in attendance at Super Bowl XLVI to watch his old team take on the Patriots. Perhaps the more surprising revelation is that Burress deeply wanted to rejoin Big Blue for the 2011 season, according to Jacobs, and as a soon-to-be free agent, may well sign with the Giants for the 2012 season.\nBurress chose to sign with the Jets last July after they offered him three times as much guaranteed money as the Giants did, according to the report, as he was coming off a 20-month jail sentence for possession of an illegal weapon. But, according to Jacobs, it wasn't easy for the Super Bowl XLII hero, who caught the game-winning touchdown pass for the Giants, to leave his old team.\n\"Oh, no question, I know he did. I know he wanted to come to the Giants,\" Jacobs said. \"We just didn't think it was going to be able to be done financially. But he may be (back) next year, who knows?\"\nWhy Burress would want to sign with the Giants is fairly obvious, particularly after an 8-8 season with Gang Green that left him watching the playoffs on his television set. Why the Giants would want to re-sign a wide receiver who will be 35 by the time the 2012 season begins is less clear. They already have two wide receivers, in Victor Cruz and Hakeem Nicks, who combined for 2,728 receiving yards and 16 touchdown receptions in 2011. Nicks is signed through 2013, and Cruz will be a restricted free agent in 2013, according to Sportrac, so both wideouts should be with the team for quite a while.\nThat being said, the Giants' next-best receiver in 2011 was Mario Manningham with 523 receiving yards, so perhaps Burress could be a No. 3 or No. 4 wideout for them. Although Burress had just 45 receptions for 612 yards in 2011, he remains a viable threat in the endzone with his 6-foot-5 build. He caught eight touchdowns for the Jets. Even though he failed to impress in his rematch against the Giants, catching just three balls for 34 yards, Jacobs said he was simply underutilized in the Jets' offense.\n\"He's a much better wide receiver than (45) catches, I tell you that,\" Jacobs was quoted as saying.\nOf course, it would be a somewhat awkward return for Burress, who left on a sour note, having blasted, in a Men's Journal article, the reactions of both QB Eli Manning and head coach Tom Coughlin to his shooting incident.\nEither way, Jacobs doesn't see Burress rejoining Gang Green, hinting at a lack of respect for QB Mark Sanchez's abilities, as well as a disgust at the state of the Jets' locker room former Steelers product posted two 1,000-yard seasons during his four years with the Giants, as well as 33 touchdown receptions, before limping off the field with a poor performance in 2008 and an even shakier performance off the field.", "label": 1}

{"text": "Decorating a Room\nBy the Editors of Publications International, Ltd.\nFaucets, Fixtures, and Hardware\nIf you're remodeling a bath, real luxury translates room for two: twin vanities, a separate enclosure for the shower and the tub, and a toilet isolated in its own compartment. Simply replacing a worn-out fixture or an out-of-date faucet, though, is enough to give a bath or kitchen a shot in the arm.\nNot anticipating taking on the entire room or relocating plumbing means more money to buy products that speak to you. Top-of-the-line hardware, a handheld shower, or a steam bath? The market is flooded with creature comforts.\nFixtures and Faucets\nWho doesn't need a stress reliever by the day's end? Enhance a whirlpool tub (remodeled units fit right into a standard tub recess) with accessories like a handheld sprayer or a cascading faucet. Design a custom walk-in shower finished with easy-to-clean ceramic tile or glass block.\nA massaging showerhead will chase away workout and stress-related aches and pains. Pamper yourself. Pile on the fluffy towels and the perfumed soaps! Decorate for all the senses as well as the eye.\nPedestal and wall-hung sinks are traditional fare. But a modern pedestal sink can also be lean and sculptural -- a worthy partner for slick surfaces. A sink with Queen Anne-style legs would infuse a spacious bath with European elegance. So would a wall-mounted towel warmer and a heat lamp.\nCounter sinks, generally of vitreous china, can be dropped in or mounted onto virtually any kind of counter. Self-rimming sinks rest on top. Simple, graceful bowls of, say, art glass or metal appear to float.\nA glass bowl atop a stone counter creates a harmonious play of light and texture. Integral sinks, manufactured from solid surfacing, fuse seamlessly with the countertop and are very popular in high-traffic situations.\nWhat to consider in choosing style and color? Dramatic dark colors may be less likely to show dirt. But, they're easily marked with soap scum and hard-water mineral deposits.\nNeutral shades adapt to all color towels and accessories and, if this isn't your dream house, will most likely please new buyers.\nIn general, simple is better in everything from fixtures to faucets. Fancy scrollwork and doodads can make the latter appear quickly dated. Instead, use shapes and forms to help get your look across. Brass is the standard faucet base material, but manufacturers offer an array of finishes including nickel, copper, and chrome for all kinds of styles including those high-arched faucets with built-in sprayers designed to take on any kind of challenge.\nKitchen sinks have revved up their personalities, too. A heavy-gauge copper farmhouse sink recalls the days when every butler's pantry had a copper sink for washing delicate glassware. A roomy apron-front soapstone sink is understated and timeless. Don't skimp on accessories here either. Cutting boards, wire rinse baskets, and colanders can ease chores as well as provide stylish details.\nHardware -- cabinet knobs and handles, drawer pulls, and window cranks -- doesn't have to match. But for uniformity, limit the number of different finishes and colors to a minimum of two or three, particularly if hardware is visible in the front entrance or an adjoining family or great room.\nClassic types of hardware like wood and brass knobs never lose their appeal. But new hand-forged metal knobs and porcelain shapes -- leaves, arrows, fish -- are intriguing and eclectic. Maybe you could find something from a local artisan who specializes in handcrafted hardware.\nIf you're rejuvenating rather than remodeling a kitchen or a bath (or a piece of furniture), replacing the hardware -- or adding hardware where none has previously existed -- is one of the quickest and easiest fix-ups you can do.\nAs a general rule, antiqued brass, nickel-finish steel, and wrought iron are considered traditional; shiny steel and chrome are modern. But shape also counts in how the hardware comes across.\nAnd clever substitutions are appreciated: for instance, rope pulls in a log cabin, Mexican concha buckles in a Southwestern dining room, seashells for the vanity in an island hideaway. In the same way a certain piece of jewelry can turn an outfit around, hardware matters.\nIdeas for small details like hardware or for whole decorating schemes surround you all the time. Everywhere you look, everything you read, the trips you take -- it's all inspiration. Keep adding to your files. To help, we've assembled some ideas of our own in the chapter ahead", "label": 1}
{"text": "Dr Lenera\nPosts: 3787\nJoined: 19/10/2005\nAn era of prosperity for the Dwarves who live inside the Lonely Mountain is cut short when a dragon named Smaug appears and drives King Thror and his people out of the land of Erebor, becoming the sole owner of all the treasure the Dwarves had mined including the extremely valuable Arkenstone. Sometime later, in the peaceful land of Hobbiton, a young Hobbit called Bilbo Baggins is tricked by the wizard Gandalf the Grey into hosting a party for twelve Dwarves. They intend to reclaim their kingdom from Smaug, and when Gandalf unveils a map showing a secret door in the side of the Lonely Mountain, it becomes apparent that they want Bilbo to serve as a expedition\ufffds \ufffdburglar\ufffd. After much resistance, Bilbo joins them and the adventure is on, an adventure which takes Bilbo out of Hobbiton for the first time in his life\ufffd\ufffd\nI am a huge fan of Peter Jackson\ufffds The Lord Of The Rings films; I think they are both excellent adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien\ufffds tale and fantastic fantasy epics in their own right, simply amazing film experiences which I always look forward to viewing again. I\ufffdm not going to take up any more of this review singing their praises; I did that in the Feature that you can access here http://horrorcultfilms.co.uk/2012/12/doc-goes-back-to-middle-earth-a-personal-look-back-at-the-lord-of-the-rings-trilogy/ , so check it out if you think I have it \ufffdin\ufffd for Jackson and The Hobbit. This review is not going to be a pleasant one to write though, because The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey just isn\ufffdt that good. It\ufffds by no means a bad movie; there have been dozens of far worse films in what has been a pretty weak year for cinema, and it isn\ufffdt an ordeal to sit through like, for instance, the equally hyped Prometheus. There\ufffds no getting away from it though; the film is a major letdown, a film that is partly misconceived, partly pointless and very awkward. It\ufffds also majorly lacking in great moments which were a constant in The Lord Of The Rings trilogy.\nTolkien of course wrote The Hobbit before The Lord Of The Rings. My personal introduction to Middle-Earth, it\ufffds a truly charming page-turner, specifically aimed at kids but something that I think can be enjoyed by almost anyone. There has been much fuss made about the fact that Jackson and his co-writers have elected to expand this book into three films, and as far as I\ufffdm concerned, the fuss is totally justified. The Lord Of The Rings is three films. The Hobbit is one. My heart sank on the day I first heard that they were going to make three films of The Hobbit, and my fears have proved to be totally founded. It seems that Jackson, a guy I\ufffdve always liked, whose films I\ufffdve always enjoyed even from the days of Bad Taste, and whose last two efforts King Kong and The Lovely Bones I constantly defended from criticism, has finally capitulated to the lures of self-indulgence and money, even if he seems to be so constantly busy that I doubt he has much time to spend much of his cash. He\ufffds turned a lively, funny romp into a bloated, forced, would-be epic. I wouldn\ufffdt have thought many fans of the book will want to see its first third played out at half speed, with many sequences elongated beyond reason and most of its charm eradicated, but nor would I have thought fans of The Lord Of The Rings film trilogy would want to see the same all over again but smaller-scale, a kind of pale shadow of its fore bearer.\nThe opening is unnecessarily convoluted. Bilbo narrates the set-up to the quest that will take place, with Smaug attacking the Dwarves. Obviously it was done like this because The Fellowship Of The Ring began with a lengthy preamble, but doing the opening of The Hobbit the same way only serves to emphasise how small-scale it is by comparison. Anyway, after this we cut to what could have been a deleted scene from the early part of The Fellowship Of The Ring, involving the elderly Bilbo and Frodo. Then, we shift to Bilbo on his own and go back into the Smaug story as he thinks about it. After such a clumsy beginning you would think the film can only get better but it takes a while to do that with a pretty dull first quarter. The beautifully done build-up of The Fellowship Of The Ring was justified in its length because things were still constantly happening, but it\ufffds not really the case here when all we have is a load of Dwarves being totally irritating even though we are undoubtedly supposed to find them lovable and charming.\nWhen the adventure eventually begins the film does certainly pick up, and while it botches some of Tolkien\ufffds best scenes like the encounter with some Trolls, the incidents keep on coming and the final hour is certainly full of action. Bilbo\ufffds famous encounter with Gollum is superbly done. Gollum looks even better than before, the tension is terrific and it certainly justifies the amount of time spent on it. I wouldn\ufffdt say the film\ufffds tone is that much lighter than The Lord Of The Rings though, though I might be saying that because much of the supposed humour just isn\ufffdt very funny. The sweeping shots of New Zealand are as breathtaking as ever and the somewhat brighter look of this film is appropriate because this is supposedly a more innocent, innocuous story [or would be if filmed right]. The detail is often very clever; notice, for instance, the contrast between the Rivendell of this film and the more autumnal Rivendell of the earlier films, though Jackson\ufffds habit for making supposedly dark interiors overly bright reaches absurd depths here. The special effects vary wildly in quality, including some CG rabbits which are astoundingly bad and which I couldn\ufffdt believe were actually considered okay.\nThere is still a lot to enjoy and appreciate though, and some children may find it easier to process than The Lord Of The Rings. Unfortunately, the whole film suffers from what seems to be Jackson\ufffds excuse for making three films of this book; his inclusion of back story virtually divorced from the main tale which he took from Tolkien\ufffds appendices. This stuff is basically material that leads into The Lord Of The Rings, but it both jars with the main story both tonally and narratively and is actually pretty pointless. The naturist Wizard Radagast, played by the worst Dr Who as hammy as can be, may be an interesting character, albeit one who tried my patience after about a minute, but the rest is pretty boring, because we all know what is basically happening and the nudge-nudge wink-wink references to things to come [\ufffdO look , there\ufffds Galadriel. O look, isn\ufffdt that.....\ufffd?] are irritating. They made a serious mistake in doing The Hobbit this way. What with the more artificial look to many scenes caused by the resorting to increased CGI this time round, I couldn\ufffdt help thinking certain comparisons made to The Phantom Menace were not entirely unjustified.\nMartin Freeman is wonderful as Bilbo, the ultimate reluctant adventurer who leaves the peace and quiet of his life into a dangerous world he would never have even dreamed of. Sadly only three of the Dwarves are given much to say and do and after a while it\ufffds hard to tell some of them apart. Snow White would have been ashamed. Howard Shore\ufffds music score gives mostly appropriate backing but has only one good new theme and most of the score\ufffds best bits reuse motifs and themes from his earlier trips to Middle-Earth. It contains one bizarrely misjudged musical passage when we hear his The Lord Of The Rings Nazgul theme as Thorin strides towards an opponent. Some songs from the book do make a welcome appearance. Now I didn\ufffdt see this at 48 fps because quite simply the film wasn\ufffdt showing in that format near me. In a few days time this website\ufffds very own David Gillespie will be offering his own views on the movie and what the 48 fps is like. I did though see the 24 fps in 3D; it was a mistake as I try to avoid The Big Con as much as possible. My verdict: what was the point? Jackson mostly goes for unobtrusiveness in the 3D, which never makes much sense to me as this devious money-making ploy is purely a gimmick that is nowhere near perfected yet, and therefore is only really justifiable as a gimmick. Considering some of his early work, you would have thought Jackson would have had some fun with the format.\nThis review has been more negative than positive, and yet The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is by no means all bad and is still a reasonably enjoyable way to escape from this world for 169 mins. That should explain why I have still given it an above-average rating. Unfortunately, it follows what I seriously believe is the greatest film trilogy of all time and is such a major drop in quality that I cannot help but say that Jackson has partially, if not entirely, blown it. I would like him to see sense and finish The Hobbit off in one film rather than two, but that\ufffds not going to happen now, is it? My overall feeling about this movie can be summed up thus: when The Fellowship Of The Ring ended I wanted to see the second film there and then and the excitement became unbearable as the release date grew nearer and nearer, but as The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey finished: well, I\ufffdm not going to go as far to say I couldn\ufffdt care less, but I\ufffdm certainly not thrilled that it\ufffds going to continue in a year\ufffds time, and I very much doubt I\ufffdll be counting the days. Oh dear.\nRating: 6/10\ncheck out more of my reviews on http://horrorcultfilms.co.uk/", "label": 1}
{"text": "Kathy Cassidy\nFirst impression on unpacking the Q702 test unit was the solid feel and clean, minimalist styling.\nIn the almost 20 years since Linux was first released into the world, free for anyone to use and modify however they like, the operating system has been put to a lot of uses. Today, a vast number of servers run Linux to serve up Web pages and applications, while user-friendly versions of Linux run PCs, netbooks, and even Android and WebOS phones.\nOne incredibly useful way that Linux has been adapted to the needs of modern computer users is as a \"live CD,\" -- customized operating system on any machine, anywhere in the world, has an obvious attraction -- as do specialized1. Test-drive Linux\nOver the years, Linux has developed from a usability nightmare into a fairly straightforward desktop operating system. With professional-quality productivity tools like OpenOffice.org for creating documents, spreadsheets and presentations and GIMP for image editing, as well as versions of familiar applications such as Firefox, Thunderbird, Adobe Reader and Flash, most common business tasks can be done pretty easily on a Linux system.\nYou can see how well adapted Linux is to your business by running several of the most popular desktop distributions from a live CD. Perhaps the most refined and user-friendly desktop system available right now is Ubuntu, which includes just about every application you could ever ask for, from business productivity apps to programs for multimedia editing, Web design, running databases, serving up Web pages and chatting online.\nUbuntu's installation disk is itself a live CD, so if you decide to install the system later you can just run the installer from the Ubuntu desktop.\n2. Recover aging hardware\nLinux in general has lower system requirements than other contemporary operating systems, but there are a few distributions that are specially designed to take advantage of old, even ancient, computer hardware, letting you squeeze a few more years of life out of systems you wouldn't even think of running Windows on -- including machines with broken hard drives.\nBoth Damn Small Linux (DSL) and Puppy Linux are designed for older systems, requiring only a Pentium 486 or equivalent CPU and 128MB of RAM to run well. DSL can even run with just 64MB of RAM. Both launch a usable, if somewhat stripped down, user interface that's perfect for tasks like sending and receiving e-mail, creating documents and surfing the Web -- in other words, basic administrative tasks.\n3. Secure your network\nLinux is already one of the more secure operating systems, since it was designed from the start as an Internet-connected system. Running it from a live CD makes it even more secure, since the disk image cannot be modified. Several distributions take advantage of the inherent security of the live CD to transform old computer equipment into powerful secure gateways for your network.\nZeroshell can be installed on any PC with a 233-MHz processor and 96MB of RAM to transform it into a fully featured gateway router and firewall. All the advanced features you'd expect from a modern gateway are present, including authentication via RADIUS server, quality-of-service monitoring and traffic-shaping, VPN and the ability to act as an 802.11a/b/g router on machines with the appropriate wireless cards.\n4. Restore failed systems and recover lost files\nWhen Windows fails to boot, smart IT professionals reach for their live Linux CDs. Whether the problem is a corrupted operating system or a damaged hard drive, you can boot up Linux from the CD drive, allowing you to read and copy files, run diagnostics or perform other maintenance tasks like partitioning drives.\nWhile most Linux distributions have an assortment of at least some useful diagnostic and recovery tools (and often, looking at a drive through another operating system can be immensely useful in itself), specialized distros like the Ultimate Boot CD (UBCD) designed to run from discs are ideal for dealing with technical problems.\nUBCD is the Swiss Army knife of recovery discs, containing more than 100 tools for performing deep sector-by-sector analysis of a hard drive's physical surface, recovering deleted or damaged files, rebuilding file tables, examining boot-sector errors and plenty more.\n5. Work anonymously\nTransform any computer into a paranoia-inspired privacy powerhouse using a CD-based distribution such as TAILS, The (Amnesic) Incognito Live System. With TAILS, you can surf the Web in total privacy -- all outgoing traffic is anonymized using the Tor service, which bounces your packets through random servers worldwide before delivering them to their destination.\nIn addition, the software included with TAILS is configured for privacy by default: Firefox comes with JavaScript and cookies disabled; the e-mail client, Claws, includes integrated GnuPG encryption; the Pidgin IM client is configured for Off-the-Record messaging, which encrypts and strips identifying information from your messages; and so on. Since it boots from a Live CD and saves no information on the host machine, once you remove the disc all traces of your activity simply disappear.\nFind more live Linux distros\nThese choices only scratch the surface of the available Linux systems that can be run from a live CD -- Wikipedia's \"List of Live CDs\" entry names about 100 different Linux versions with live CDs, as well as live CDs based on other operating systems such as BSD, Solaris and even Windows. If you have a preferred Linux version, check the list -- chances are it will run from a live CD, with all the portability and security benefits that implies.\nLogan Kugler is a frequent Computerworld contributor.
