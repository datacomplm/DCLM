## Introduction

[DataComp-LM (DCLM)](https://datacomp.ai/dclm/) is a comprehensive framework designed for building and training large language models (LLMs) with diverse datasets. It offers a standardized corpus of over 300T unfiltered tokens from CommonCrawl, effective pretraining recipes based on the open_lm framework, and an extensive suite of over 50 evaluations. This repository provides tools and guidelines for processing raw data, tokenizing, shuffling, training models, and evaluating their performance. 

DCLM enables researchers to experiment with various dataset construction strategies across different compute scales, from 411M to 7B parameter models. Our baseline experiments show significant improvements in model performance through optimized dataset design.

Already, DCLM has enabled the creation of several high quality datasets that perform well across scales and outperform all open datasets.

  <em><b>Developing datasets for better models that are cheaper to train.</b> Using DataComp-LM, we develop a high-quality dataset, DCLM-BASELINE, which we use to train models with strong compute performance tradeoffs. We compare on both a Core set of tasks (left) and on MMLU 5-shot (right). DCLM-BASELINE (orange) shows favorable performance relative to both close-source models (crosses) and other open-source datasets and models (circles).</em>

**Submission workflow**:
* **(A)** A participant chooses a scale, where larger scales reflect more target training tokens and/or model parameters. 
The smallest scale is 400m-1x, a 400m parameter model trained compute optimally (1x), and the largest scale is 7B-2x, a 7B parameter model trained with twice the tokens required for compute optimallity. 

* **(B)** A participant filters a pool of data (filtering track) or mixes data of their own (bring your own data track) to create a dataset.

* **(C)** Using the curated dataset, a participant trains a language model, with standardized training code and scale-specific hyperparameters, which is then 

* **(D)** evaluated on 53 downstream tasks to judge dataset quality.

## Getting Started
To get started with DCLM, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mlfoundations/DCLM.git
    cd DCLM
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    Before installing the dependencies, make sure cmake, build-essential, and g++ are installed, e.g., by installing:
    ````bash
    apt install cmake build-essential
    apt install g++-9
    update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-9 90
    ```

3. **Set up your environment**:
    DCLM uses AWS for storage and possible as a compute backend, and ray for distributed processing.
    Ensure you have the necessary environment variables and configurations for AWS and Ray clusters.

## Selecting Raw Sources
If you are creating a new source:

- Ensure your data is stored in JSONL format (ideally compressed with zstandard).
- Key names should be consistent with those in [here](baselines/core/constants.py).
- Create a reference JSON in [exp_data/datasets/raw_sources](exp_data/datasets/raw_sources).

If you are selecting a raw source for downstream processing:

- Identify the raw source you intend to use, which corresponds to a dataset reference (i.e., a JSON in [raw_sources](exp_data/datasets/raw_sources).
- The reference JSON contains the URL to the actual data and other metadata used as input for downstream processing.

## Processing the Data
To process raw data, follow these steps:

1. **Define a set of processing steps**:
    Create a pipeline config YAML file specifying the operations.
    See our [reproduction of C4 for example](baselines/baselines_configs/c4.yaml). 
    Further details on defining a pipeline can be found [here](baselines/README.md).

2. **Launch a Ray cluster**:
    Use an appropriate Ray cluster based on the size of your dataset and specific YAML configurations.

3. **Run the processing script**:
    ```bash
    ray attach <your_cluster_config>
    cd dcnlp
    export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)
    python3 ray_processing/process.py --source_ref_paths <source_json> --readable_name <name> --output_dir <s3_output_dir> --config_path <config_yaml> --source_name <source_name>
    ```

4. **Monitor and tear down**:
    Track progress via the `global_stats.jsonl` file in the output directory and ensure to tear down your cluster after processing.

## Tokenize and Shuffle
To convert raw text into tokenized datasets and perform shuffling:

1. **Set up a Ray cluster**:
    Follow similar steps as processing, but use [ray_processing/cluster_tokenize_shuffle.yaml](ray_processing/cluster_tokenize_shuffle.yaml).

2. **Run the tokenize and shuffle script**:
    ```bash
    python ray_processing/tokenize_shuffle.py --source_ref_paths <source_jsons> --readable_name <name> --output <s3_output_dir> --content_key text --do_sample --default_dataset_yaml <mixing_yaml>
    ```

## Model Training
To train a model using the tokenized dataset:

1. **Run the training script**:
    ```bash
    torchrun --nproc-per-node 8 -m training.train --scale <scale> <tokenized_json> --logs <log_dir> [--remote-sync <s3_bucket>] [--chinchilla-multiplier <multiplier>] [--clean-exp] [--report-to-wandb]
    ```
   
You can expect the following training times per track:

| Scale  | Model parameters | Train tokens | Train FLOPs | Train H100 hours | Pool size |
|--------|------------------|--------------|-------------|------------------|-----------|
| 400M-1x| 412M             | 8.2B         | 2.0e19      | 26               | 137B      |
| 1B-1x  | 1.4B             | 28B          | 2.4e20      | 240              | 1.64T     |
| 1B-5x  | 1.4B             | 138B         | 1.2e21      | 1200             | 8.20T     |
| 7B-1x  | 6.9B             | 138B         | 5.7e21      | 3700             | 7.85T     |
| 7B-2x  | 6.9B             | 276B         | 1.1e22      | 7300             | 15.7T     |

2. **Monitor and manage your training jobs**:
    Use slurm sbatch scripts or Sagemaker for running experiments on various compute infrastructures.

## Evaluation
Evaluate trained models using the following methods:

1. **Preferred Method**:
    ```bash
    python tools/eval_expdb.py --start_idx 0 --end_idx 3 --filters name=<filter> --prefix_replacement <prefix_replacement> --num_gpus 8 --output_dir <s3_output_dir> --eval_yaml <eval_yaml>
    ```

2. **Direct Evaluation**:
    ```bash
    torchrun --nproc_per_node <num_gpus> eval/eval_openlm_ckpt.py --checkpoint <checkpoint> --eval-yaml <eval_yaml> --config <model_params_file> --model <open_lm_config> --output-file <output_file_path>
    ```

## Submission
When you finished training and evaluating your model, a model eval json file has been generated and is at [exp_data/evals](exp_data/evals). 
You can now open a pull request to the main repository to share your results with the team and submit it to the leaderboard.
